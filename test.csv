"1. Muffins made easy
2. Made easy for Maximum enjoyment. Yes please. 
3. I don't like the word fuss. Again it makes me feel think of stress or mess. I love the simplicity and ease of this concept.
4. Muffins I associate with mornings/breakfast. I'd bake it in the morning after working out... to enjoy/eat around 11 or noon alone since I do intermittent fasting and don't eat until noon. Blue Diamond Muffin mix cuz it's almond based with healthy ingredients and no crazy terrible additives/preservatives."
"I put A family breakfast as 3rd choice. I noticed it because it is a favorite that everyone in the family could really enjoy and I like the idea of eating healthy ingredients with the family. It can be improved by talking a little more why this is a good start to the day. I would want to enjoy them with my family at home, for breakfast, and I want it to be special so I chose a fresh muffin mix. I feel good because it is healthy and delicious and no one can even tell."
"1.  Bake Now, Enjoy Later is my third choice. 

2. The phrase ""claim back your mornings"" definitely caught my attention.  At least for me, mornings are usually a hectic time.  Having something  that is healthy, tasty and ready to go would be great.

3.  I think I would just include more about the healthy nutritious aspect such as made with high quality almonds.

4.  I would be getting ready to leave the house for work in the morning and I would feel rushed and anxious thinking about the drive and day ahead of me.  Grabbing a Blue Diamond Muffin would be the perfect item to take with me because it's nutritious, ready to eat and portable."
"1. I like that it mentions plant-based and almond - which suggests it is grain free and/or gluten free. Highlighting these two qualities, and being easy to bake, would be my preference. Also, I'm not sure what your plans are with the sweetener -but I'd be more apt to buy it if it had a lower glycemic or organic sweetener (ie. not corn syrup or cane sugar) but instead coconut sugar, stevia, monk fruit, etc. That would make it excell as a top product in my eyes that'd I'd for sure by regularly.

2. Muffins to share with the whole family, plant-based and made with almond flour to give you a high-quality, gluten-free treat! (or   -easier to make than ever before!)"
"1. Plant forward goodness 
2. The concept of Decadence & quality. I liked the notion of GF & DF but the emphasis is placed on “decadent” and “lift” and highest quality. All words I really resonate with.
3. Really don’t like “plant forward cake”. Makes me think of greens. That name doesn’t make me think decadence. I think of green cake which doesn’t make sense to me and I don’t want to try it. Maybe words like nourishing, that speaks to the body and complimenting diff dispositions is better.
4. At office or at home. Taking a break from work in the afternoon or at night after dinner. Alone by myself. Time for an easy to digest treat."
"Convenience is the one that I put in 3 place because it is important to have convenience but ingredients and taste are the number one. Convenience, taste, plant based are words that stood out to me. This concept could be improved with different toppings that have different types of benefits. 
I would want to have them while I am at home, feeling like I want something sweet, but nothing that will hold me down and make me feel gross. It is evening time and I am on my own or with my husband. I feel like enjoying something sweet after a long day."
"I chose craving convenience because it's after a long day and I want something fresh but quick and easy.  I think I would omit ""fleeting"" because it makes me feel like if I just wait a short time my craving will be over and I won't need a treat.  I would include the ""natural"" concept.  Again, my favorite place would be on the couch after dinner when I am watching t.v.  I want to relax with a tlc as a tasty treat."
"1. More negative space/minimal modern in design. Less clutter, less to read. Motion graphics for pop and attention grabbing.
2. Personally, I don’t use microwaves because I’m concerned how it may change the molecular structure of the food and alter the quality and nutrients. So I wonder if there’s alternative ways of eating this for people who may not microwave.
4. I noticed this Instagram ad for its cleverness and the way they structured their campaigns: marketing. It felt fresh, youthful, great sense of humor and fun."
Someone that feels like running even after having a treat because it is light and doesn’t weight you down.
"They key concepts would be mentioning the quality natural ingredients made from california blue diamond almonds, the quick easy prep and cleanup, and satisfying treat.
I chose this Charmin ad because I found the thank you an impressive angle.  They appreciate their customers. Stating that we are all one community is inclusive and makes me feel like we are in this together."
"1. I think pushing more the almond part of your product is key. You need to distinguish this from all the other brownie and cake mixes out there, and your product is unique in the almond aspect. 

2. I don't think so

3. There is an instagram account from Japan called kurashiru that has AMAZING ads of their foods. The pictures are really really appealing, and they have short videos on how to make them. Their account is the best I've come across in making their foods look appealing. I almost always click on them!"
"1. The overall design look and feel that feels friendly, modern & fun.
2. Delish healthy baking at home during lockdown? and Vegan, gluten & dairy free? Here you go."
"1. Plant based, high quality almond flour would get me to notice. 
2. #Plantbasednutcakemixes It says exactly what the product is and what it is made out of."
"1.  An image of a delicious looking dessert.
2.  A new way of baking.  A healthy alternative is almond flour, a natural, dairy free, gluten free product.  Try it today."
"1. Quality you can trust
2. ""Wholesome goodness"" and ""sourced directly"" are quality words I like.
3. Quality home baking with a twist... what's the twist? Will there be suggestions for additional fresh ingredients the customer can personalize to their mix?
4. At home, alone around noon or afternoon. Time for some comforting alone time. Make myself a turmeric or matcha latte. and have the oven going with the Baking Mix cuz it feels like it'd be healthy. I'd add fresh ingredients to amplify or spice up the mix."
"1. Bake together with love was my 2nd favorite concept. 
2. I liked the family love, the sharing, sharing good ingredients, learning healthy young. 
3. This concept can be improved by giving some examples of what these family favorites are to get us excited and back to our childhood. 
4. I am at home with family, feeling loved and close to each other, after dinner. I feel like making a delicious treat for the family without the long mess."
"I chose Fuss Free Favorites.  I liked the concept of being simple.  I think enjoying a homemade baked item that is easy to put together is a plus in this busy world.  I like the phrase ""maximum enjoyment"".  I think I would add the fact that the almonds are natural and California grown.  

It's a Saturday afternoon where I have a little extra time to prepare a treat and since it isn't complicated, I can put it together easily and quickly.  I feel good that I am preparing something for my family to enjoy.  After I take it out of the oven, I am going to treat myself to a sample before anyone else.  I will sit back and relax and share it with my family later.  I feel like a Blue Diamond Baking Mix because it's quick, easy, somewhat healthy and tasty."
"1. If the verbiage can be even more concise and impactful. Feels like theres too many words to grab my attention on Insta. Almost a graphic, bold visual approach to get my attention.
2. Speak to baking alone, esp many people can't share with loved ones the baking experience now that we are still in lockdown or not able to be in physical presence with each other as much."
"It would be good to say that the texture is moist and the flavors that they come in, while still being the healthiest and most convenient cake ever made. 
Can't think of an ad but being transparent about the ingredients that are being used, is very important and how they make you feel after you eat the product."
"I would use visuals of quality products that are used in the mix such as fresh almonds on the side, cocoa beans, quality chocolate etc.

The quality, healthy, natural gluten free, dairy free ingredients made easy and ready to share with family and friends sums it up."
