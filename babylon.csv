" I am not proud of this but unfortunately, I am somewhat of an ostrich (always sticking my head in the sand) when it comes to my finances. I am easily overwhelmed and become avoidant of any interaction I need to have with my bank. I put off a lot my financial responsibilities until the last moment and then am even more stressed about having to deal with issues in a time crunch. I have strong negative associations with most financial institutions and typically want to hide from them...I can become very avoidant of my finances and feel anxiety around money in general. 
 
 """"Careful"""" __¡° I am not a risky spender; I try to keep my overheads very low and within reason. As I am a freelancer, my income isn__t always consistent or stable, so I need to compensate for slower work periods by keeping my spending in check and always saving. I have invested in a mutual fund and some stable stocks, but I don__t play around with my investments because I feel like I don__t know how to manage it on my own very well. I try cover my bases and make sure I always have a solid safety net. 
 
 """"A work in progress"""" __¡° I feel like I am still very much in the process of figuring out my finances. I live abroad from my native country, so I am dealing with multiple currencies and tax issues, I have my own business as well so that creates a lot of instability and difficulties. I am trying to take steps towards my future by doing things like having a Roth IRA account and paying social charges toward my retirement, but I am not certain that I know the best ways to be financially independent in the future. I am open minded about new investment options but also haven__t gotten swept up in the waves of things like crypto, I still feel like I am soaking up information and trying to figure out my next moves.""",4
"""Focused, Skeptical, Balanced.
 
 Focused because I want to be able to really research the information, especially if it__s something new to me before I jump in. 
 
 Skeptical because I want to not get overly excited about something that I may not know much about to avoid getting scammed or just making uninformed decisions.
 
 Balanced because I like to calculate my risk and that comes from me learning a lot about the risk before I decide to get involved.""",2
"""1.-trust: I once read that believing in an economic system is a mental disease. I don't remember quite the explanation but it made me think of how fragile is to set the entire world functioning on the believe of money. Because that is what it is, just a group of organized people that choose to believe on the value of money to help keep a society organized. Subsequently, people born in the system grew up believing that money has an intrinsic value. That is why I choose the word trust, not because I trust in money and finances, but because trust in money is the web that keeps society organization together. And ironically when you realize this, money becomes not as reliable as someone would thought.
 
 2.-opposition: I had a really good childhood as far as I remember, but as I grew older I realized more and more the efforts of my parents to candy coat the reality for me. Going one day later on vacations to find money for gas or things like that. I choose the word opposition cause money and finances as much as the put order into society, they also consume people, it turns the main reason to live. My dad used to told me that working is so terrible that you have to be payed to do it. He used to tell me this as a joke when I complained of my first job. But I never agreed with that, if it is so terrible why do I have to do it? I was 16 years old, and even it was just a summer job I felt miserable thinking of all the years ahead. The word opposition fits perfectly, cause I grew up with a constant anger towards money, as if it was an entity that I was rebelling from, punishing it with my opposition. I now realize how absurd is that.
 
 3.-abundance: Now that I grew up, my relationship with money also has evolved, but this is all thanks to crypto. Knowing the stories of people that changed its life from one day to another made me realize I could be one of them. Before I could never dream of becoming financially free, that was something reserved for people born into it or sold into a slaving system of hard working translated into stress and company devotion. 
 Now I see money just as the opportunity to have options and financial freedom as something that can be achieved not necessarily by luck or inheritance. My relationship to money changed completely and now I'm looking for abundance not only for myself, but become the instrument myself to spread abundance around me.""",4

"FREEDOM- I always thought money equalled freedom. That was until I secured a fantastic job in IT. It was dream job with high pay but I lost my freedom. I had money but I did not have time to enjoy it. I reflected back at teenage me and realised I had time but no money- that was not freedom either as I had no money to travel and do things that enabled me to enjoy my free time! I now look at other friends who have a lot of material wealth but are chained to jobs they hate- in order to pay off this material wealth- this is not freedom. I realised money is either freedom or handcuffs! I have since quit paid employment and made money freedom for me. GLOBAL - money is global, it needs to be used worldwide in order to maximise the freedom it delivers. It means I can purchase items I want from China, US, anywhere in the world. It also means I can use geo arbitrage to maximise it's value. I can pay for my items in any currency I choose- making an items cheaper or more expensive. I have virtual assistants in Philipines at a 1/4 of the price of my previous UK assistants. I buy flyers from Australia at half the price of European printing. I use money globally to maximise it's purchasing power and I make money on these transactions. MUST BE SPENT- money depreciates, inflation decreases it's purchasing power. Money must be spent in order maintain or increase it's value. Money sitting in bank account after 20 years is worthless, invest that in a house and you could be on a gold mine. Money must be spent to ensure it beats inflation and does not become worthless.",2
"I describe DeFi in contrast to normal finance or centralized finance where the banks are at the center of everything and they are in charge of everything __¡° thus every single financial interaction with them is designed to serve the bank or institution in some way, i.e. they make money off of your money. They also design things to be very complicated and annoying so that you end up owing them more money from dumb reasons like ___maintenance fees.__ Centralized finance is like you are a part of some big money-making machine and act as one of many contributors to the success of the financial institution. 
 
 In DeFi, the individual has the power and is at the center of everything. This cuts out the banks and institutions from benefitting from the chain actions of the individual__s purchase. They stop making money off individuals spending money because the money is handled by you (or the individual) and goes directly to the vendor or investment you are contributing to. DeFi is an open system that is still unregulated and in development but has some very appealing aspects to it as it could change how we go about lending and spending and lets people be more autonomous. But it also could maybe more easily be hacked or riddled with scams, so it is still something to be a bit wary of.",3
"I would actually provide the warning first. Reason being because I talk with people often about the DeFi world and the approach coming from them is usually aggressive and they leave out the negatives. I would warn them about the perils of not doing your due diligence and fully understanding DeFi as a concept and then how it applies to what they are interested in. Next I would describe defi as the early stages of the next financial revolution that removes the control of traditional banks and/or institutions and it uses technology similar to that of cryptocurrency. The promise of DeFi is the elimination of fees, stronger security by using crypto type wallets and fast transfer times.",2
"I've explained DeFi to my loved ones so many times, and the most basic and easy way is to realize that DeFi is a financial world run by you for you without intermediary. People to people, pier to pier, P2P. I always tell them. In Mexico is very common for small stores to not accept credit or debit cards because of the fees generated by the bank, they don't want to pay those fees and buyers don't want to absorb that fee either. I always tell my family for them to imagine a way to transfer that payment directly to the owner's store, rather than having the bank doing that for you and getting some money for themselves in the way.
 Picture the network that is created when many bank users make transactions, all of those lines go through the bank first, making it like a bottleneck inefficient system. Now, picture this same network with people having the ability of making this transactions directly to other users, the network image that is created is more clean and organized, it connects you more and gives you more freedom on your decisions. DeFi is this, decentralized finance, you making your own decisions not only on transactions, but also on compound, interests, trades and all of the regular services that usually someone does for you and you don't even realize.
 DeFi promises the ability to be really responsible of your own finances, gives you the opportunity to make your own choices, strategize and experiment with your own resources. And also and for me the most important that is the opportunity to access to wealth with the same chances and opportunities than everybody else. For me this is the lifechanging trigger that I would love to express deeper with all of the words in Spanish that comes to my mind.
 It may sound crazy but that is the greatness on DeFi, the opportunity to materialize wealth from nothing, same opportunities without mattering where are you from, your background, education or family.
 With all this new freedom and opportunities also comes it's own dangers, there is no light without darkness, and being this a new space, scams and rugs are everywhere, but not only that. Human errors comes along with using DeFi and that is what I warn everybody that is new into DeFi. In regular finance, if you make a mistake you can call to your bank and have it solved. In DeFi this is not the case, you miss one single character and your transfer disappears forever. You mess on a decimal point and same. DeFi is very liberating but with that freedom comes responsibility.
 Always do your own research, and if it's possible, never use any platform or escrow or anybody that tells you they will trade for you. Learn and do research, it's a wild space but also very rewarding, I prefer to loose my money because of the mistakes I make while I am learning rather than loosing my money to a scammer. It might be frightening, but it is only frightening because we can't believe that all of that abundance is there to be taken by us.
 Never trust anyone but yourself and take the time to make educated decisions.",4
"I think I would ask people to think about how technology always feels rooted in our past metaphors. Before the Internet; Books would not suffice as an adequate metaphor for what 'shared knowledge' would look like in 2022. 
 
 Likewise, DeFi, if you consider the constituent technology - BlockChain, is not really just about 'Decentralisation' as a means to enable cryptographic ledgers to be proven to exchange tokens of value - or in other words, governing an exchange of value without the need for an individual (rather a collective) to approve it. 
 
 Rather, the exciting part of what DeFi is and represents is a shake up to current power dynamics. This is why it is also considered somewhat dangerous or unorthodox.
 
 Now, before we get all Sci-Fi or Comic Book-esque, I do not think this is about DeFi being 'for the common people' and a way to 'stick it to The Man'...the issue being that most people who are engaged with DeFi are usually educated, monied, and have networks to support them in this 'gamble' on a new future. 
 
 It is not shock that after some nay saying and threats, many of the financial world have some stake in DeFi, as part of a spread bet on the future. The 'common people' - even if they have a little flutter on some BitCoin are not really engaged with the DNA of what DeFi is and will become. They are simply buying into a pyramid scheme, and are not really controlling the larger narrative on what a world with DeFi is and will feel like. 
 
 I say this not to sound cynical, but more to say I think things will come full circle - the powerful will likely stay powerful. This is not the French Revolution. 
 
 So what is the positive part? Well, I think like the Internet, the powerful will still reap large rewards from the new technology as they invest and shape it to what serves them best, however, there will be 'crumbs from the table', which will make everyday people's lives much better. Just as most people are not Silicon Valley Bros, most people have better healthcare, more connection, better access...etc. than ever before. Even the 'poorest' person in say the USA is rich by standards 500 years ago.
 
 So the question is not just one of money. A new form of international 'Value Exchange' is not going to bring us global harmony. Rather it will simply bring the world closer together as a collective - only now our data will be intertwined with our value. We will not just own a car or a house, those purchases will be 'encoded' with a historic 'DNA' or what lead us to make that decision and that purchase. 
 
 DeFi would be more correctly called DeDaFi, [Da = Data], as this is as much a part of the new power. Just as Knowledge is Power, so too Data must also equal Knowledge - and so Power again. 
 
 I do not watch DeFi in terms of 'money', I watch it in terms of 'markers' on our behavioural psychology. 
 
 Every breath you make, every click or step you take, DeDaFi will be watching you. 
 
 Does this become Black Mirror? No. For the same reason Books did not destroy is, nor the Internet. I hope that we eventually transcend the circle of 'money' and get to 'value' - and from that to something greater than transactions. We need to strive for togetherness, and I think DeFi is a part that is moving closer to that, for all its casualties to come. 
 
 I remain optimistic that we will look beyond our singular selves.",4
"The corruption of Governments, Bank Debts, Money laundering that has grown on a vast scale since the 
  development of the Chinese Mixed economy and the collapse of the Soviet Union, make DeFi an attractive prospect. A dependence on permanent Inflation for fiscal stability has left the global financial system on a permanent cycle of growth and collapse, with the gap between the richest and poorest expanding.
 
 DeFi - offers total financial collapse on a scale not seen since the 1930s, because of the looming prospect of 'Infinite Money' leading to total Monetary collapse. There is no established restriction to the amount of crypto currency that can be created, nor the division of that currency, to create endogenous inflation.
 
 Moving from poor monetary control to poor control is unlikely to end well, and Nation States are unlikely to relinquish the power to confiscate funds.",3
"Decentralised finance removes the middle man. It makes it cheaper and easier for anyone to purchase goods, lend their money and borrow money. With centralised finance, your money is held with bank accounts and corporations that are regulated by governments. They charge fees and put stringent requirements on who can use their services. Alternatively, decentralised finance gives access to everyone to store, spend and borrow money with low to no fees. Decentralised finance does make it more difficult to recover money that is incorrectly sent to another person and may be more open to fraud. It is not backed by government guarantees to ensure your money is safe.",2
"I would be happy to be away from banks and financial institutions. I really hate dealing with my banks and feel like they are always out to get me or making things overly complicated and expensive. I think it would also be nice and convenient to have everything in one space, like a virtual wallet rather than multiple bank accounts.
 
 But I would also feel immediately overwhelmed and vulnerable. I would suddenly be in charge of everything, and I don__t feel impowered enough or educated enough on these systems to confidently continue this way. I would want help in the form of a knowledgeable advisor or something to help steer me through this process. I feel a bit like this is a whole new thing to really learn and I would love to have safe / secure guidance in this space.",3
"I would be comfortable with that because that__s what I have been building towards any for the last year and a half now. The majority of the things I create now live in the metaverse. The music, the visual content, etc is all capable for transition to DeFi if they don__t exist there already. I feel comfortable also because I stay on top of the phenomenon and I am aware of the foundational aspects of the technology.",2
"I already feel like this, as all of my wealth is in DeFi. Haha, I'm sorry, I think this question doesn't apply to me, or at least applies as the opposite.
 I'll answer as if it was my parents wealth the one that suddenly appears in DeFi. Honestly I would be very happy, I don't think it's wise right now to have your wealth in USD, at least not while we don't know how the future will look.
 The more users are at DeFi, more services will accept it. Right now you can live on DeFi, obviously with its difficulties and not as easy as centralized finance, but it is possible, and every day it will become more available. There are crypto ATMs around the world and again, I'm not saying it's easy but it is a possibility. If all of my wealth was turned into DeFi I would strategize and study even more to settle that wealth into residual income. I would use Centralized finance as my loose change to daily usage but not the money that I work.
 
 But I understand the emotional background on this question, I think I'm passed that but I remember when I used to put all my heart and hope into the Centralized Finance and felt scared that my money would be in danger if it wasn't locked by a bank or institution. That meant that I didn't trusted myself to be in charge of my own money. And banks are good at doing this, selling you the idea of safety, making you feel that you are not good enough to do it by yourself and you need help. Or not being so drastic, just people that don't want to do anything with finance and prefer someone else does it for them.
 But if you really understand the system you realize how fragile it is and that not even a bank can guarantee the value of your money and can easily be lost or diluted if major issues in the world arise.",3.5
"OK, so I was not expecting to 'push back' on a question, but this is needing some additional hypotheticals - you'd need to imply I can't just 'cash out', which I would take out at least 2/3 and sink 1/3 into more stable asset like housing, and keep 1/3 liquid. 
 
 Anyway, suppose I was 'all in', I would clearly feel like I was betting the farm, this is because the Crypto market is still immature, and is not stable. It may have gains, but it has significant losses, which as someone who is not rich or comes from money, I cannot afford the exposure. 
 
 However, if you said I could only transfer within DeFi, this would be more interesting to consider, as I would still then diversify the folio, and look at risk ratios yet again. 
 
 ---
 
 Now, if this was 2050, I would be more relaxed if my money was in DeFi. Like any new technology, this would have allowed the hype and the fuss to level off, and it would be as stable as anything else I suspect. Right now FSCS does not back DeFi - but in 2050, I'd wager it would cover you to _¡ê85k the same as anything else.

"Very nervous, I would seek to spread across several currencies. If my bank goes bust I have the chance of some recourse to recovery via the Government protections. If everything was in DeFi, I have no protection - it's a bit like owning uninsured leasehold property in a war zone.",2
"I would feel insecure. I feel that my money is safer in banks in order to prevent fraud but it is safer with DeFi in terms of governments stopping the freezing of assets or seizing assets. I would feel comfortable having my wealth mainly in revenue generating assets, a proportion in DeFi and then a small amount in centralised finance. At the moment, you also need to have a small amount in centralised finance in order to be part of the 'boys club''- I have a friend who is a multimillionaire with all his money in crypto- he can't even rent a property as he doesn't have bank statements or a credit history.",2

"I wrote some of this in the sign-up, but primarily, it seems like a lot (almost everything) revolved around ___settling down__ for the previous generations in my family, and even in my own generation in the extended family. Everything needed to be expanded __¡± persons in the family, possessions, income, property, business, porofessional roles___ My huge break is that I__m happy to remain narrow in most ways. I want to snake around the nooks and remain largely free; a river rather than a tree. Of course, I have professional/academic aspirations and I want to expand some abstract things, but I don__t aspire to have a larger place to stay, I don__t want a vehicle unless I live in a place where I can__t do without one, I don__t want to settle or even stay in one place for more than a few years at a time, I don__t intend to grow a family and raise children (might adopt aging cats, at the most), and beyond wanting a certain amount of excess/saveable income, I don__t really spend any time planning trying to attain a progressively increasing income. Narrow. I__m not a minimalist or anything; I like nice things and experiences but I just don__t want to *splat* someplace and proliferate in every shape and form. Not that it's a bad thing -- My parents and their parents planned their life and that of their families in a certain way, giving them different needs and restrictions in terms of career-building and money-making to the ones I need to consider. Of course, I would have to embrace some of the same things they did if I chose to be responsible for a unit of humans; but I don__t choose that and just need to cater to my *own* needs and the shared needs of my relationship (which, being shared, are not heavy). That changes a lot and frees up a lot of bonds that would otherwise exist.
 
 Clearly, they also use and save money differently. I don__t come from a rich background __¡± there has been a good deal of class mobility that my family has gone through over the last two generations. This usually implies a huge inclination towards racking up savings and spending cautiously, which I__ve inherited to some extent. However; I also grew up in more luxury relative to my parents and grandparents due to said mobility, giving me___ let__s call it a (vast?) difference in priorities. For example, when they were able to afford it, my parents started buying grains of a higher quality, more expensive dairy products, more nuts and dry-fruits for us to munch, and so on before proceeding to spend on other items. Given the same amount of money, I would rather stick to the original cheap food and use the extra coin for a book/gadget/piece of clothing/accessory I need. My use of the word ___need__ is loose; it could range from objectively necessary for core life activities to something that makes a certain things slightly more convenient. At some stages I legitimately *have* skipped meals and eaten a very limited range of things (with equally limited nutritive value) for extended periods of time while also spending money on lots of travel tickets around the new country I then lived in, a few clothes I didn__t despise, a hair-straightening treatment I deeply believed I needed for people to not hate me on first sight, and my first camera. My parents would find this quite unfathomable; and my grandparents would most definitely have a stroke!! And yet, I __¡± I honestly think it__s fine to do that if money gets that tight again___ Maybe we really are doomed. __¡§__¡§
 
 And finally, there are the practical things: cash vs cards!! I think even people just a couple of years older to me find that they spend card money more loosely than cash. They say that cash, which physically changes hands, is easier to keep track of. I__m the opposite!! I__ve used online banking since the beginning of my money-management journey, got my bank__s apps whenever they first came out (just when I was entering ___adulthood__ (apparently) I think), and have been using services like apple pay for years already. I__m used to conceptualising my savings as numbers on a screen. So every time I__ve withdrawn money and have to use actual banknotes, I feel like I treat it as ___free money__ that doesn__t actually belong to my pot of gold!! It__s like __¡± if I don__t envision the transaction changing the amount on my account page, if I don__t envision a slot with a minus and a red amount showing up for that particular transaction, it feels like it doesn__t count as much! 
 It might just be me being weird but it would also make sense that handling physical money as little as I have in recent years should have an effect on our perceptions about it.
 
 Sorry -- I've just realised that this answer got really long!!",4
"The main difference between my family and me is that I do not want to have children of my own (I come from a large family on my parents' and grandparents' sides). I prefer to dedicate my time, energy, and resources to helping others, to improve the living conditions of people who are already alive and exist. 
 I would consider fostering later in life.
  
 Another difference would be that I like the idea of being able to travel and live in different places, while both my families have always stayed in the same country (they only moved across cities). 
 I understand there was a language barrier for my grandparents, but my parents did live in other countries while studying and chose to come back to the city they were born in their late 20s and have never lived anywhere else ever since.
 
 There's also a difference in the approach to money and finances.
 I have learned a lot about money management and investments from my paternal grandmother. 
 She has invested in properties, stocks, and others since she was younger. My dad enjoyed the family wealth and never really felt like taking financial risks, but I tend to be more adventurous when it comes to finances. I am aware this comes from the privilege of having a family that would be able to provide a financial safety net if needed. 
 Most people in my family are state employees (mostly teachers, state lawyers, and doctors), while I first worked as a freelancer and currently have my own business with my partner.
 
 Overall, my values and beliefs align with those of my dad's family. My grandma graduated from University in the late 50s, worked all her life, was in charge of the family finances, and still drives a car. She used to be very religious but started questioning her beliefs later in life. She is now very open-minded: she rejects dogmas, homophobia, and the overall structure of the church. I love how she worked to improve herself all her life, and I have learned a lot from her.
 
 My mom's family was poor, so I prefer not to compare myself to my grandparents as I understand they came from a different time, and the people around them did not push them to want to make a change or question their beliefs. Nonetheless, I learned the core values of family, community, and empathy from them.",4
"My father left home when he was 22, applying to university through the local library in letter form, I left home at 18, applying to university through the internet with a few clicks. His generation without a doubt worked a lot harder, but I also believe that they had a lot more faith in the world. I think we lack the optimism our parents had as we are faced with more adverse problems in our time, with global warming and living costs.
 Having read On The Road by Jack Kerouac, the narrative of floating through life, and having the privilege of being in America to do so, its partially truthful fiction, it's a biography. To my generation, it is romanticised struggle; the modern day couch surfing while one looks for a stable job, I guess one can approach this through a more poetic lens. 
 The difference in mindset is, meaning, which is what my generation lacks, as previously mentioned being burdened by issues out of our control, the significant drop in currency, affordability of estate, and the accessibility one has to follow their ""dreams"". Can we even afford to pursue said dreams anymore? The struggle in trying to create a space that merges survival and turning dreams into reality. I have met people that have been in put in circumstances when their dreams are pushed so far out of reality that a 9-5 and a bed with no central lighting would suffice. How can meaning replace survival, does meaning make survival more tolerable? Isn't the same way they speak of faith?
 I never really knew my grandparents. I know that my father's parents were wealthy but without inheritance; he was the director of an industrial fan factory, all my father got was some jewellery him and and his sister had to fight over. My mother's father was a farmer or mechanic, I feel shame in not remembering which, but they grew up in poverty, villagers of the global south, the original foragers. I think they had more strength in persevering than my generation. They had no access to health care like I do, how could they have dealt with depression brought on by the poverty? Having no choice but to keep it moving. The privilege I have to take a break, be unemployed and seek therapy, I do not deserve the opportunity to take a breath, this is not how I thank my ancestors.
 It is a vain generation. Who demands this much of attention towards their physical appearance? It is obscene that the most polluting industry is fast fashion. As someone i knew once said ""get a life""",4
"Personally i think the biggest difference between our generations is following the trends. Our parents and Grandparents mindsets were stuck on education and the rest of the world. Just like the banker boom were everyone thought they could make fortunes. The truth is only some did. Their attitude looked more toward the future. get a good education, secure a stable job in order to work your way up the ranks enough to have a nice retirement. I think this is to do with the uncertain time they grew up in. Stable job and income means you can plan your life around it. Today, i think that education is becoming less important as anyone has the ability to learn basically anything thanks to the internet. Although i do agree with a good education i think that everyone should discover what their passion is before pouring all their time and effort into it. I don't want to follow the crowd, i want to create something unique. In the meantime i don't mind jumping jobs and just enjoying the experiences that i have. I am not focused on retirement and living a good life in the future. I'd rather focus on now. I want to enjoy the time i have doing something i love. I think that if you just enjoy your life opportunities will come to you and in the end being happy is all that matters.",3
"My family members are very different from each other. I am the closest to my dad, life-wise: he is very young-spirited, outgoing, open-minded, has lots of hobbies (we share the love for music and reading, although polar opposite genres), and knows who he is as a person. Currently, I'm experiencing a long-term burnout so I don't dream of becoming a businesswoman anymore, like he is - always looking for opportunities, even in dark times like the current war between my home country and Ukraine. This is where my mom and I are similar. Like her, I am looking for a stable job, the ability to be promoted, work 9/5 and just live a simple life, locally. It is very different from my ""usual"" same, but I got so tired at the beginning of my 20s (I'm only 22 now, so I know how silly it sounds), that I just want to survive, even if it means living on the bare minimum. I used to feel superior to people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, but now I see why this could be the desired option, instead of living in constant stress of chasing the financial independency like my dad. My grandparents are very usual local people needed to the society, which I like a lot. My grandad was a PE teacher at school and now is an Olympic trainer. My grandma was a state accountant for her hometown. They never dreamed of something big, they just wanted to have enough for their parents and kids. Before my master's, I dreamt of continuing the breaking of the poverty cycle, just like my dad did. But now that my youth maximalism is over, I just want to have enough. And I distantly believe that's what should everyone strive for - to not be in abundance, to not be suffering. To have just enough.",4
"My mindset is so complex, but the bases are simple, study and work, on that matter we think the same, but it's kinda different, and I'll tell you why:
 My father says that he only wants to work till he dies, and make us happy, but I think that is because he didn't have a proper education, and didn't have his parents when he was turning an adolescent (Both died when he was like 10-12) and he was the one who had to work in a social club helping a lady with the kitchen's work. He only knows that lifestyle, and im trying to convince him that he has to live his life, that life involves more than work, and he has to have some fun now, but, for that to happen i have to get a really well paid job, and that's why i'm studying so hard!.
 Money is something we all need, but the ways we spend them, that depends a lot from human being to human being. My mom has the economy of the entire house in her hands, and she's really good with it, because, if there was no more money, at least we would have food and supplies (because here in Argentina, it's so difficult to end the month with a little bit of money). She has always been a great leader for her family, and us, she teaches us how to properly use money, and how we can develop a great financial mindset.
 They taught me how to properly behave, how to be empatic and honored, and i've tell them, from my position, ways to make them lives easyer, that they already had done too much, and they have to start taking care of themselves, so they don't have to end with a lot of healt problems when the get to elder ages. And that i'm not a kid anymore, even if i were, they have to talk important things (Healtcare) with me, i don't think they made a lot of mistakes, but i will improve some little things when i get to be a father",3
"I probably worry more. My generation seems to be rather fraught with anxiety and stress. The milestones that governed our parents and grand-parents lives (university, getting marrried, buying a house, having children, retiring) are becoming less and less reliable and predictable. We have little to measure our progress by and so our (and my) approaches to life, work, and money are all incredibly varied. I just try to take it year by year for now. Without knowing what my life will be like in terms of relationships, career, etc, it's a matter of figuring out what's feasible and what makes me happy, and then doing my best to get there. Even the people my age who know exactly what they want and how to get it, it's generally a completely different path to previous generations. Our motivations are different; for instance, we've all grown up under the looming threat of climate change. Money seems to be worth less and less. A mortgage is a distant dream. Technology, too, has had a considerable influence. There are so many pathways in life now that didn't even exist 20 years ago, and it's changed how we socialize, find partners, and even our work lives. LinkedIn is a staple now. We value different things because we SEE different things, as the world gets ever more interconnected, as poltiics continue to be as messy as ever. We pay such close attention to things like politics because we hardly have a choice, with technology shoving it down our throats every hour of the day and with this omnipresent weight of ""responsibility"" we (or at least I) feel about making the world a better place. It feels very much like we're running out of time, so the future becomes either a dream, or a mission.",4
"ALL the money in the world? But just everything that exists now or do I control the flow of money here on? I__m setting up UBI, of course!!! Universal Basic Income, for the uninitiated, means that every person simply receives an ___income__ on a regular basis that covers, to a good extent, the costs of their basic necessities. It differs from existing social welfare programmes in that it is not needs-based. It is not a new idea, but in recent years it has been worked on more seriously than it had before and large-scale studies and experiments have been conducted to observe real-world consequences. I had thought of writing a well-referenced summary in here, but giving myself that entirely unnecessary task has already led me to procrastinate for a few hours so I__m going to have to leave the research up to you if I am to hand this in on time :D (here, ladies and gentlepeople, you see in action the answer to your first question___) And__¡±to answer the burning question you__ve probably got__¡±from what I__ve read so far, no, communities where similar schemes have been implemented did NOT show a significant decrease in employment rates.",3
"Having all the money in the world sounds very overwhelming. It would be crucial to surround myself with experts and people I trust as a first step, to work together to put them to good use.
 
 Once we created a diverse and inclusive team of experts and consultants, we would be working towards various goals, primarily focusing on education, infrastructure, self-sustainability, and research.
 My understanding of how funding, NGOs, private companies work is extremely limited - so these thoughts might sound all over the place BUT, here's to wishful thinking:
 
 We would create funds accessible to NGOs and non-profit organizations worldwide to create better living conditions for their local communities. Whoever takes the funds will have to provide public and detailed accounts of their spending.
 It is important that these organizations would be local, as I guess they would have a better understanding of the issues of a specific territory/community. They would help produce workplaces locally to create self-sustainable economies independent from their countries' governments.
 
 I imagine these projects would take years to create, so we would also help fund organizations supporting immigrants worldwide and allowing free movement of people worldwide. I do not believe in political/territorial borders. 
 We would also work to create adequate infrastructures of all kinds (clean water, roads, schools, buildings, etc.) worldwide.
 
 We would create funding for research/technological advancement (including medical research and others) so that it can be aimed toward benefitting everyone, not only individuals/the rich. It would also stop the gatekeeping of knowledge from private companies.
 
 Overall we would try to finance organizations and communities to empower them and create self-sustaining and regenerative economies.
 
 I remember reading about this project in Bangladesh where a community of sex workers started a self-supported bank offering microcredit/microloans to that same community. They were able to open a nursery and schools and guarantee a better future for their children. I understand this also has limitations, but I appreciate the idea of communities being able to invest in themselves. So that's what I would like to work towards - creating visible and palpable change so that people are incentive to re-invest in their community.
 
 All of this would, of course, only work without the interference of governments and para-political groups. 
 
 So the foundation to all of these ideas being actionable and for them to work lies in education: to let new generations know their rights as citizens so that when they grow up, they will push for these changes from the ground because they themselves believe this is possible.",4
"I don't know if its a myth when they say that billionaires could feed the world and reverse poverty, but thats where I would start. I would buy out fast fashion factories and turn workers into scientists and farmers. Also pay off my overdrafts.",2
"We live on such a beautiful planet with the most amazing cultures and people. But unfortunately there is also so much suffering. 11% of the population live in poverty, people work jobs they have no desire to do, we destroy nature to fill our pockets. I believe there is a better world where we can achieve our dreams but still give a little love back.I believe that everyone deserves to not worry about the basic needs of living, food, clothes, water, shelter, education. That would be my first priority. We have so much innovation and technology. But unfortunately it doesn't always get used for good or its original intention. Phones were made to bring people together, but i feel like its pushing everyone apart. Technology is the key to helping people all over the world, the ecosystem, we just have to use it the right way.I also do not believe that giving people money is the answer to our problems, but purpose and fulfillment. I don't understand why we all learn under the same conditions, learning the same curriculum when we are all so different. I would change the current school system to an adaptive style. People can learn what interests them, and hopefully that gives them the drive to succeed in any chosen field. There is so much wasted talent, if only everyone had a chance to shine and be passionate then i think the sky or beyond is the limit.",3
"I would research more deeply into charities that are out there. The first one I would donate to regardless of its demand is a charity for supporting the lives of stroke survivors and any medical research investment that is going into preventing it. My grandfather died because of it and he was my closest person in life. Secondly, I would donate to food banks in developing countries and invest in the better organisation of food recycling in developed countries. Thirdly, I would use the money to promote and implement some recycling policies in other departments, like e-waste (which is HUGE in the upcoming years, I wrote a dissertation about it), textiles, plastics, and wood. Even if it means I'll have to bribe people, I don't care. I believe that in the current world, some unethical choices need to be done for the greater good. Before doing all the abovementioned steps, I would pay off my education loan, and my family's debts, and give some money to my dad's new business in agriculture, as it's in big demand for economically-shuttered Russia. I would also secure some money for my children's college if they decide to go into academia after graduating from school (if I'm lucky to have them or adopt them). For all savings-related issues, I would hire a personal financial consultant because I'm clueless about stocks, investment strategies and all that fancy stuff.",3
"If i have all the money in the world, that means that a big part of the world, is so poor, that they can't afford food. I wouldn't want that, but if i have no chance to have all this money and power, i probably would try to encourage development of science and healtcare, food distribution and electrycity, in all the places that are now poor, and try to change how the world works.
 I love how science has made way better our life expectancy and quality, but i can't comprehend how we don't unite and try to develop more thing like that and not another atomic bomb u know? I don't know what would kill us first, global warming, diseases, or ourselves.
 There are some things that money can't buy, and happiness is one, we create the money to have some order, but the money ended creating some of the most greedy and wicked people i've heard, we are al passengers on this world, why won't you try to make it a better place for all?",3
"If I really have ALL the money, the global economy is probably in shambles and I have bigger problems. If I'm just exceptionally rich, I would invest most of it in land and property, and fund some charities/green ventures. My friends and family would get a large cut, and then, to be honest, I would live a life of luxury. Being financially secure is one of my major goals because I do enjoy the finer things in life; obviously I would prefer to have earned it rather than have it handed to me in this theoretical scenario, but I would still take advantage of it. I do feel a sense of responsibility to share the wealth in some ways- particularly with the world falling apart as it is- and because there's really only so much money one person needs, but I certainly would've give it all to GreenPeace and live the life of an ascetic. It's an incredibly arrogant way to look at it, but frankly: there are plenty of rich people who are a lot worse than me, and I'd rather have it in my hands than theirs. (Please take that with a grain of salt!)",3
"I__ve never used it but I thought Klarna was pretty cool when I first saw it __¡± democratising EMI payments is a cool idea! (could turn exploitative easily, but if done well, still a cool idea.
 
 Among tools I__ve personally used, I love Wise so so much. I__ve lived in so many different countries over the past few years and without a tool like that, I would have struggled so much more with transfers and exchange rates (as I did at the start, being super wasteful with a scammy ___multi-currency card_____) they__ve made global living and mobility so much easier :3 much appreciation to them!
 
 And something old but gold that I recently got into? Fixed deposits. This may sound silly, but thank heavens we still have something for people that want to put money aside and let it grow a bit without having to spend ages figuring out how to invest in real stuff!",3
"One of the most interesting things I've seen recently is DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and horizontal profit splitting (all members of a community earn some profit just for being a part of the community - somewhat similar to universal basic income?).
 
 The concepts of DAOs and horizontal profit splitting were introduced to me by a friend who is a trans-right activist and digital artist. We were both parts of a thriving digital community that became well-known and popular among womxn and non-binary digital artists. However, the person who started this community quietly decided to trademark the community name under their own and did not allow people within the community to gather/organize under the community name any longer (as of course they had now become solely responsible for all activities run under the group name, which became a lot to handle).
 
 This situation was very upsetting for many people, mainly because it was done ""in secret"", so my friend started another digital community - a DAO that pushed digital art marketplaces to implement horizontal profit splitting from digital sales within the members of the DAO.
 
 They argued that the previous community grew popular because of the value that every member brought to it, so it would have not been fair for individuals to profit off of the community name without involving everyone, which I agreed with.
 
 Some things need to be clarified when someone enters a DAO with horizontal profit splitting, such as that they need to guarantee participation within their possibility - so that they're not only making a profit off of joining. But overall, I like the idea of being able to support others directly.
 
 I am a little skeptical about some aspects of horizontal profit splitting. I believe different levels of effort should be rewarded in different ways, to encourage people to want to improve/achieve more. But I also believe in the value of community and active participation. I know it requires time, energy, and effort - and these should be rewarded.",4
"This whole world of Non fungible tokens and cryptocurrency is still a mind boggle to me. Its inclusive yet exclusive simultaneously. How on earth? And what was the first one, who, one day, decided that this was going to become reality. I am fascinated by friends that have a 5 year plan, who give me insight on how to make and prioritise money in life. I was told that I simply cannot rely on creativity fulfilling the yearning in my heart, but also to make space for finance, after all how will I live.
 The amount of funding in the arts is also baffling. Being someone on universal credit, on minimum wage, and hearing about an art director who just secured 30,000_¡ê for a 2 day exhibition, fair enough.",2
"I know everyone is saying it but Crypto currency and its possibilities with the Meta verse. As someone who is only just starting my career i am looking for ways to help grow my portfolio while doing the things i love. I've always considered starting my own business and am always looking for ideas and ways to do so. I think that Cryto has a massive ability to help with smaller startups when/if it moves to more of a company base rather than coins. I am hoping one day that anyone with an idea has the ability to create a startup token/platform on the crypto network for people to invest in. It gives people opportunities to take control of their money and invest in aspects that interest them. Linking this with the Meta verse gives the ability to communicate ideas face to face with potential clients, as well as give everyday people the opportunity to get involved in projects all over the world. Im excited for a more integrated financial system that brings people together in innovation.",2
"I really like the Starling app which I use. 3 things that are cool to me. First, colourful statistics of spending habits. The emphasis is on colourful and cute icons that they have there, Barclays app could never. Also, cool UX design, everything is super clear and stylish.
 
 [I've just discovered how to make a new paragraph here, I'm BLIND.]
 
 Secondly, they show your upcoming payments in the history already, so you know how much money you should have by which time and date. It's great for young people, as there is no illusion that you can somehow avoid the payment, and you simply don't forget about it.
 
 Lastly, I like their ""spaces"". You can create a space for savings, a space with a _¡ê200 limit for an additional cardholder to help you with groceries and small household purchases, and a space for your child's card. So your kid can have a physical card with a limit you set for them, linked to your app. My brother who's 10 has something similar, which teaches him responsibility for financial decisions from a young age. Also, it's a safer option for keeping his Birthday money in one place.",3
"Cigarette butts are the most discarded object in the world, trillions are thrown away every year.
 An Indian startup had the best idea i've ever heard, they separate the filters, paper and tobacco so they can make teddy bear filler, and with the paper and tobacco they make a mosquito repelent. They have just make a sustainable, eco-friendly, and with zero raw material cost! Also, they have created a lot of new work opportunitys for the people, i think that's cool because we need more reciclying and ecologycal ideas to activate the market for a better and healthier world!.",4
"Not NFTs, I can say that much. If it's strictly ""most interesting"" than perhaps it would be the story I saw on BBC about the man who got an implant in his hand that he could pay with. I still like to use cash, so, it's not that I want to follow that route, but it does evoke a bit of science fiction. What would it mean for us, as an entire society, to be so connected with the economy that our finances are literally stored in our bodies? Is that healthy, psychologically? My instinct is no, but maybe the whole concept of psychological health is changing too. But to me, it feels like a blatant surrender to something that we as individuals should be in control of. I don't want my money under my skin, where I can't look at it, pick it up, put it down, set it on fire if the wild urge strikes (just an example). I worry that social networks will go the same way, and soon we'll never be able to ""turn it off"", and we'll always be on a network: contactable, traceable, and monitorable. Paying with an implant might seem like a fantastic, modern, convenient way to keep track of your wallet, but it feels dangerous. At what point do the lines blur completely between a person and their money? It's already so tied to self-worth, to career prospects, to relationship success. But maybe I'm reading too much into it.",4
"I have a few little mantras or sayings that guide my approach to life. They might be a little cheesy, but they ring true to me: 
 
 ___Go with the Flow__ __¡° I am a firm believer in following opportunities that life presents you. Feeling free and open is incredibly important to me. I 
 
 Freedom and openness allow for infinite possibilities, and I am always impressed how in life, one thing can lead to the next, you just have to say yes and see where it takes you. Plans never work out exactly how you want them to, being adaptable and flexible are essential to having a good time regardless. 
 
 ___Appreciate the little things in life__ __¡° I am someone who can take a great deal of joy and pleasure from the small things in life. I try to remind myself that just because it is small, it doesn__t mean it isn__t important. Luxuriating in something ___small__ like a nice cup of coffee or a fun phone call with a friend, add up to your overall happiness for the day. I also feel like whenever I have a cold, I find myself thinking ___I didn__t know how nice it was to just feel normal!__ Which is a little dramatic, but I think it speaks to appreciating what you have. 
 
 (I also once had a fortune cookie in Italy that said ___Appreciate the little things in life__ (in Italian) and I made a resin necklace out of this for a jewelry project I was working on at the time. This also maybe speaks to my appreciation of small details and the sentiment is maybe why I got into jewelry design in the first place.)",4
"One of my life mantras is what goes around comes around. Another one of my guiding principles is to be the person you needed when you were younger (when dealing with kids). Another guiding principle is to try to spend as much time with loved ones (friends and family) before they are gone. And lastly, do what makes you happy, while trying to ignore the negativity and nay sayers around you.",2
"1. The biggest rewards come from the biggest risks
 2. Never stop learning by connecting with unexpected people, keeping widening your circle and spend time with people different from you and trying out new things
 3. What is the worst that could happen? What is the best that can happen? Mitigate the risks",2
"My life mantras? Wow, no one has ever thought me so wise as to ask me for advice on how to live their life, but here goes___
 
 Never devalue yourself to please others. This can generally mean, ___know your worth__ but I think this life lesson I__ve learnt specifically through my experiences dating and falling in and out of love with men over the years. I have begun to realise that my past patterns of behaviours, of shaping myself into the potential girlfriend I thought this person wanted or needed, was seriously damaging my own self-esteem and sense of identity. I actually had a bit of an epiphany moment about the age of 28 (hello, saturn return!) where I realised just how much I was short-changing myself for a certain person and had done so much in failed relationships before him. Since that day, I really understood the principle of embracing my true uniqueness and letting that lead me, so that someone who truly fell in love with me would find me one day. Apart from my love life, this guiding principle has seen me through toxic friendship battles, career mistakes and more!
 
 Don__t underestimate the importance of being silly - wow, this one has truly only sunk in since I__ve had a baby! Since when did adulting become so SERIOUS and hard. Children are truly the eye openers that help you reconnect with your own inner child and appreciate life from such a unique perspective. We all grow up and start wearing the cloaks of expectations we__ve picked up through learned behaviours, societal expectations and our own upbringing, but children literally demand that we have fun and go about our business as if no one is watching. If we all managed to embrace this in our daily lives a bit more, we__d be able to deal with the bigger, ___adult__ issues a lot more level-headed, I__m sure. It__s only through having my own son that I__ve realised just how much we forget to have fun as adults! It__s so so important to pull silly faces, belly laugh from being tickled out of the blue and twirl around in our living rooms just for the hell of it. 
 
 Always believe that your daydreams can come true one day - This one is different from the popular idea of manifestation. I don__t actually believe that if you visualise something strongly enough, it will happen to you. What I do believe is in the power of dreaming of something bigger than your life right now, that you have the capabilities and energy to put something into practice that gets you excited and gives you a sense of fulfilment. Take my business idea for instance. Although it__s been on the back burner for a number of years now, I__ve never given up hope that I could potentially make it happen one day. I know it will involve a lot of hard work and research, but the fire in my belly means that I truly believe deep down that I am worthy of success.",4
"There are a ton of generic quotes that resonate - mostly along the lines of 'life is a journey, not a destination'. I try to enjoy today, while planning for tomorrow - it's a balance of both and you can never know if you're striking the right balance. However, I've known too many people not make their planned future - why risk asking 'what if?' - so I tend to get on and do it. That said, I also try to look at my life through a lens from the future - when I'm an old man, looking back, what would I think about the choices I made? Why did I make them? I want to be content looking back at my journey - that I tried, I didn't make too many errors (or learned from them where I did) and I establishing a heartfelt communication with others. That when I didn't like something, I did something about it, that when I was offered an opportunity I took it, that I experienced many things - both good and bad.",2
"My personal mantra is to treat others the way I would want to be treated in all situations. I know this seems very simple, but I truly believe it is a great way to live life. It simply isn't worth being rude or nasty to people most of the time. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and see things from their perspective. In addition, I am fiercely loyal to my family and friends. I try to strike a balance between being too trusting and too cynical.",2
"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
 While it's nice to be optimistic and assume everything will turn out just fine, I think we all need to ensure we're protected against downsides. I make sure I'm properly insured, and try to keep a couple of months non-perishable food on hand (which was useful during the food supply chain issues early in the pandemic). When travelling, it's always nice to have back-up plans e.g. alternative trains/planes to catch, alternative things to do on days with bad weather etc.
 
 Don't believe anything you read
 I'm highly sceptical and it's become a useful trait over the last few years - there's so much bias in the media and so much unsubstantiated hearsay on social media (which the mainstream media then reports as news, oddly). Keep questioning!
 
 Follow your interests
 It's way too easy to ignore your interests / passions / heart and be too logical. For instance, taking a well paying job over a low paying one may be logical but if you hate that high paying job then life becomes a grind which could lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms.
 
 Find out what makes you happy
 It could mean having a pet or a family, it could mean becoming CEO of a FTSE100 company... Or it could mean reading a book on the sofa or spending the weeking videogaming.",3
"I really feel like I was promised that if I went to a good school (university) and worked hard, I would have ___a good job.__ I fell for this myth. This has not been my experience. I think many people in my generation left college / university and were slapped in face with how difficult it can be to find a solid career / path (especially doing anything ___creative__ like working in jewelry / fashion.) Competition is insanely high and exciting opportunities are sometimes hard to come by. Maybe I__ve made the situation more difficult for myself by being an expat (so language and visas become an issue, then the strikes in France, and the Covid hit) but for a long time I was actively looking for work with a solid CV with 7 years of experience and 2 good universities and a master degree and STILL struggling to get interviews, let alone jobs. This struggle and my natural inclination toward juggling a bunch of side gigs, led to me opening my own freelance business in 2021. 
 
 Also, the notion of ___a good job__ has really changed for me since living in Europe. I think back to my last fulltime job in NYC before I moved to Paris - I was a Design Director at a Jewelry company where I was not paid that much (considering it was NYC) and I only had 12 vacation days a year and no sick days (this was illegal, but I didn__t know it at the time.) They offered me 10 vacations days and I managed to negotiate for 12 but this was barely any vacation days and if I was sick, those days came out of my vacation days (again, illegal). Long before that, I also worked an internship at a major fashion brand for 4 months without signing a single piece of paper __¡° they did this on purpose as this lets them have interns work for free without offering school credit or pay and then there is no paper trail. Fashion is notoriously a bad industry, but it is crazy the conditions people work in and for very little pay and very little time off. In the US it feels like workers are not taken care of, but the companies are protected. In Europe and especially in France I really feel that the individual worker is protected more than the company, people have contracts (no ___fire at will__ nonsense), people have health care automatically, and the standards for time off really encourage a more normal work/life balance. A good job to me now is not just one that pays well or at least fairly but one that respects people__s time and allows them some freedom with their time off.",3
"Being an adult is fun/better haha! It's so stressful! I am always looking for an ""adultier"" adult.",1
"The biggest myth I was told was go to school, study hard and get a stable job then the house etc. 
 
 Why?
 
 The people who have the life I want did their own thing, followed their passions and went outside the box. 
 
 You can__t really create something new by following the norm, following the path and following the ___correct__ approach. 
 
 I was always told, get a job with a pension and a career that is recession-proof. 
 
 I think most people have this myth that if you work hard, you get rewards. But, in reality, it is if you work smart, you will be rewarded. 
 
 I think the most connected and strategic people win.",2
"That grown-ups know what they__re doing. Haha! Biggest joke ever! Not one adult that I know of, has the answers to most of life__s biggest challenges. Not one. Yes, we all fumble on by and manage to buy houses, get married, have children, the usual steps to adult-hood that a lot of us subscribe to. Is that the winning formula? Absolutely not. If you even reach certain milestones in your life that you think make you worthy of being a proper adult, I__ve often found that the feeling of success of achieving that thing is short-lived. Outstripped by nerves, imposter syndrome, you name it. We__re all winging it and constantly trying to figure stuff out.",2
"That there was a tick-list of things you need to achieve to be successful in life - a job, a car, a house, a marriage, kids, holidays and that life was linear and consistent and rewarded you if you were too. It's total nonsense. Chaos and change are vital and should be embraced. There are infinite ways to 'do' life - all are valid - and we should absolutely encourage change, growth and trying and experiencing alternative approaches and views. I started that way but saw quickly how it would unfold and decided living in a small town, seeing the same people all the time, working in a business park office and settling wasn't going to cut it for me. I wanted to see and experience more - so I quit my job, applied for roles in a totally different career in London and moved down on my own. I'm now on my third career, just about to change roles and leaping into something bigger that will stretch me. Change is good! Long gone are the days of 2.4 children, the 9-5, working 40 years for a company to get a gold watch - entrepreneurial spirit is as valuable as years of service, diversity of experience delivers better outcomes, heterogenous teams achieve better results, age is not a limiting factor. On a personal level, I keep reminding myself that you don't need more stuff, you can wear what you want, you can live how you like - it's challenging sometimes to always remember that. I had a fortunate home background and schooling - I felt and still feel to a degree) an obligation (to build on and deliver on that beginning. But the reality is that my parents, friends, wife, etc. couldn't care less what I do or achieve as long as I'm happy. So I am mindful of that and am trying to incorporate more of that into my life - using my stability and progress to get more out of life's journey.",3
"I think the biggest myth I was told as a kid was that if you work hard, everything will work itself out in the end. While I think that is true for some people, it's certainly not true for everyone. For people born in many parts of the world, for example, no matter how hard they work, there will be limited opportunities. As I grew up, I learned that life is definitely not fair, and that many people have the deck stacked against them just because of where and when they are born.",2
"Work hard now and reap the benefits later.
 I always believed that if you worked hard early in life, you could relax later. You know, if you got great exams results at school and university, got a good job and worked hard for the first few years, you could relax due to all your knowledge and experience. 
 That's simply not true. Working hard simply gives you the opportunity to work harder later on. It really doesn't seem to let up, at least not in professional corporate jobs anyway!
 That said, I'd probably act mostly the same if I had my time again. I wouldn't drop out at 16 believing there was no point, I'd just be less surprised and dissappointed when my workload went up over time rather than down. It's all about managing expectations!",2
"My biggest hope is to find balance. Steadiness with some flexibility is SO appealing to me. I think this is my ultimate goal. I want to work but also have time for myself and time to travel! Is that too much to ask? haha 
 
 My biggest fear is that I__ll constantly be struggling. I feel like it would be really nice to reach a point where I can relax a bit and don__t have to be ___hustling__ for work. 
 
 I also worry about the way things tend to work out for me (and probably everyone else!). I feel like I have periods of time where I have absolutely no work and I am desperately searching and wide open for it but nothing comes. And then, the second I have something, it seems like 8 other projects get offered to me all at once. So, I am constantly fighting for work when I have the time to do it but then I don__t get it and then feeling absolutely overwhelmed when it all hits me all at the same time. I suppose this is called balance and it is something all freelancers must deal with but this sort of thing really gets to me.",2
"My biggest hope is to live a fulfilling life, in that I get to travel, have a career that I don't dread going to, not be stressed about money, and have inner peace (stop being so hard on myself). One of my biggest fears is having my life or a loved ones life cut short.",1
"I hope that I continue to create and cultivate more sources of income so that I have stability and knowing that money will flow to me regardless of what happens. 
 
 I hope that I can reach the stage where I can support financially the people and business that are doing good for the world, startups in climate change, forestry etc. 
 
 I hope that I can live more of my dream life - work when I want, where I want, doing multiple things to receive an income and spending time with people that energise me and help me grow. 
 
 My biggest fear is the standard of living for everyone will deteriorate. I won__t be able to afford clean drinking water, because it will be scarce; I won__t be able to breathe clean air and will need lung medication due to poor air quality and we will all become asthmatics; and there will be food shortages as agricultural land become barren. 
 
 I also fear about not having enough money for a comfortable life for myself when I am older. But, my bigger fears are for the world at large. 
 
 I fear that future generations won__t be able to have some of the experiences I have had, or enjoy life in the same way or have better experiences than my own. 
 
 I also fear being one of those people who can__t keep up with the world and access resources. Like when you see older people who can__t use websites to access their pensions. 
 
 What if I don__t keep up with the metaverse and can__t access my online therapy treatments?
 
 Now, people who are not digitally native are at a big disadvantage. What if I become one of the web3 illiterate? 
 
 But my main biggest fear is not living up to my full potential and being the person I could have been.",3
"Biggest hope is definitely feeling like I__ve given back to society in some way and done something that serves my wider community creatively. By community, this could mean locally and involve people I know or strangers. As long as I feel as though I__ve done the best I can to take action and improve the general collective life around me, rather than selfishly taking - physically and metaphorically from those around me. I also hope that I can be the best mother possible, not perfect, because striving for perfection only causes anxiety, but I hope my son grows up feeling as though he was surrounded by love and support in whatever he wanted to do with his life. I__m imagining a world where my local high street is full of independent business, each with their unique stamp on the community, surrounded by public art and finding it hard to choose from local art, music and cultural events for me or my family to go to. To see young people truly exploring their creative passions and genuinely believing that they can find work continuing them. To see people from all walks of life, collaborating on community projects and making positive impacts to the environment.
 
 Biggest fear is again, probably feeling like I__d not done something out of fear itself, fear of achieving something has stopped me from even trying to start it, so I hope that whatever shape my life takes, I feel as though I__ve embraced that fear and taken every opportunity I can along the way.",3
"That I'll never find out what it was all for or if I did it well. There's no 'summary', no 'review'. I like stats and objective views! Without that feedback, we can only really try and enjoy what we're currently doing, fix it if we don't and look after the people that are around us since they're the closest thing we have to a review mechanism. It's a bit existentialist for a Monday morning!",2
"My biggest hope in life is that I am able to start a family in the next few years. My wife and I recently got married and we are aiming to have our first child in 2023, and will probably have a second 2-3 years afterwards. Raising happy and healthy kids who have good values and go on to do something positive in the world is what is most important to me. On the other hand, my biggest fear is that I (or someone I love) will get seriously injured or sick, in a way that will change their lives for the worst. Between car accidents, extreme weather events, and the high prevalence of diseases like cancer and heart disease, there is a fair chance that such tragedy will strike at some point, and I am certainly worried about that possibility. However, I do try to compartmentalize those worries so I can still live in the moment.",2
"Hope:
 To own a nice house on the beach somewhere sunny while being privately wealthy and never having to work or worry about money again.
 
 Fear:
 Never being able to afford to stop working. 
 We're in a world where investments are volatile, cash is valueless due to overprinting / modern monetary theory and we've got hyperinflation setting in with prices going crazy. Taking a sabbatical or retiring doesn't seem possible does it?
 This wouldn't matter so much if I loved what I did and never wanted to stop (the dream is to get paid to do what you love to do and would be doing even if you didn't get paid, right?) but the reality is that if I could have retired at 40 and chilled I would have (the film Office Space speaks to me!).",3
"Success to me is the absence of desperation. Being able to say ___no__ to jobs and not feeling guilty or like you should have tried to force something that maybe wasn__t a great fit is ___being successful__ to me. It means that you have a degree of certainty that you don__t need to do everything, you can be selective and put your energy into things that interest you and that are compatible with your schedule. I think it is also about having an abundance mentality (as opposed to a scarcity mentality), you don__t have to accept every job that comes your way because you know that there are plenty of other opportunities for you and that you can cope until that time comes. It is just being more relaxed and comfortable. Anxiety is taken out of the equation.",3.5
"I often think about this, actually. I think too often we experience societal pressure to have a lavish house, a new car every so many years, the newest/latest gadget, etc to measure how successful you are. Personally, I think being successful is being happy with your own life, being a good, caring human and achieving your own goals you set for yourself. You don't have to constantly climb the career ladder. If you are happy with your current career and you're not a manager or a high earner, that to me is success. I think having inner peace (one of my goals) would make me successful. Traveling once or twice a year is success to me. Having a house that feels like home is success to me. Doing what I enjoy = success. So, I think just achieving your own goals is what success is. Screw the societal pressure.",3
"Successful for me is being able to be paid for being me. 
 
 For example, I have multiple talents and interests but only a few generate income - UX and ideas. Success for me would be generating income from multiple diverse sources so that no matter what happens in life, I am going to meet my basic needs now and in the future. 
 
 Success is being able to take a day off to meet a friend or spend time with family without having any negative consequences. 
 
 Success is about the resources, means and time to pursue my passions. 
 
 Success is about building a legacy for the people I will leave behind and making their life a little bit easier. 
 
 But, I really like my Mum__s definition of success the most: Success is leaving the planet in a better place than how you came into the world.",3
"Being successful to me, is a complex mix of emotions if I__m quite honest. My gut instinct is to say, it doesn__t involve money. It presents itself as feeling like you have had a positive impact on those around you in some way, however private or well-known your actions become. On the other hand, I can__t deny that enjoying the finer things in life; food, travel, home comforts, is tied up a lot in having access to above average income and so money does play a factor in what success means to me. As much as I__d like to say I don__t play into capitalist culture, I think that__s quite naive and it__s also not something to be shameful of, to want more money to be able to buy yourself nice things, or at least feel as though your life is easier and free of worry.",3
"Being able to support my family and friends. Having a stable base - shelter, food, safety - for me and for anyone else that needs it both now and in the future. It's an uncertain outlook - my wife and I have enough for now. But things change and my wife, my family and my friends may all face challenges - I'd like to be able to help if someone needs me. That will be my measure of success. It might be financial support, it might be moral, it might be emotional - it might be empowering someone to make their own change - I want to be able to be there for others.",2
"To me, being successful means having close relationships with family and friends, and doing work that makes a positive difference in the world. When a successful person passes away, he or she is remembered fondly by a large number of people. I think being able to take care of yourself and your family financially is an element of success, but monetary success is not that important to me.",2
"Being successful means a few things, not all of which would have to be simultaneously true:
 - being independently wealthy so I'd not have to worry about work or having a boss again
 - having time to myself, and the money to do what I wanted.
 - having a happy, healthy family
 - being respected / renowned for my achievements (and having some achievements worthy of respect and renown, of course!)
 - feeling like I'd fulfilled my potential and done everything I wanted / was capable of doing, and having done it well",2
"I think I view money as a safety net. Because my work is freelance and inconsistent, I try to always have a ___cushion__ for slower months. I am not at the point where this cushion can last for a very long time and when I have to tap into this cushion, I feel extreme anxiety and the desperation for new projects / work really intensifies. Money is not something I like to think about, it is of course necessary, but I wouldn__t say it is the driving force in my life. For example, I am more interested in working on exciting projects than higher paying ones. Unfortunately, I don__t yet have the luxury of only choosing projects I love, I still need the better paying ones, but I hope that one day I__ll be in that position. I do feel that I__ve set myself up to have the freedom I crave __¡° I set my own boundaries and have a very flexible work schedule which I really like. So, in that way I feel successful, but I don__t think I have personally reached monetary success yet.",3
"Unfortunately, money plays a huge role. I mentioned wanting to travel- that takes money. Buying a new/different home would take money. Money is an everyday stressor and thought for me. I have been thinking about going back to school for my masters because the company I work for will pay for it. Or, do I leave my current company and look for a higher paying job that maybe I won't dread going to? So many of my life decisions are based on money because do not want to being crippling debt and I am not ""just wing it"" type of person. So, money plays a role in my career and schooling. Money plays a role in my inner peace meaning hopefully one day having a good, solid money earning/saving/investing strategy will allow me to not stress about money everyday. Unfortunately every detail in our society comes own to money.",2
"Money gives me the ability to improve my life and other people__s lives at scale. 
 
 Time is a limited resource, but money isn__t. 
 
 By money, I don__t just mean conventional money - pound sterling. I mean large sums of money coming from multiple sources and multiple ways e.g. crypto, other foreign currencies, shares , bonds etc. 
 
 I want to be able to use the money I earn now to better fund my future and work for me. 
 
 During the pandemic, I learnt how to trade on the stock market, which actually helped me out at that time due to investing in a down and pulling out on a high. 
 
 This type of money factors in success for me, because it is passive, using the skills I have and can work while I am doing other things. 
 
 So, for me money factors into success because using money to make more money means I am able to delegate more of the mundane stuff to other people e.g. taxes, admin, cleaning, cooking etc. to other people and make their lives better, while I use my energies, talent and time on things that match the things I want to do.",2.5
"As above, money is certainly tied up in all of the above. I would be quite ignorant not to appreciate my privileged position in life to even be able to daydream about bigger things than simply paying a mortgage and having enough food on the table. But, there__s shades of grey and there__s a delicate balance between not appreciating the value of money, respecting how you spend it and not driving yourself into tricky financial positions and conversely, become obsessed with money as your primary, driving factor in life as well as having money based items as an integral part of your identity e.g designer items, lavish lifestyle etc.",3
"It's a means to an end. It's an enabler. It lets you add good things to your life and to the lives of those around you - experiences, things, some 'stuff'. It lets you avoid some of the negatives, or remove some of life's obstacles and challenges - it can buy you time and that's the most valuable commodity. It's the cause of and solution to most of life's problems - but it's a lot simpler than many people believe, woefully misunderstood, terribly taught, obscured behind terms and conditions and both hard earned and easily lost! It's something we should all think about more and worry about less.",3
"As I mentioned in my answer to the previous question, I think having enough money to provide for yourself and your family is extremely important. Without that, life is extremely difficult and stressful. That being said, I don't think financial success is the most important type of success, or that simply making more and more money is an admirable goal to go after. I do love to see when those with a large amount of money use it to do good in the world, though. In that way, their pursuit of financial success leads to better outcomes for a large number of people.",2
"Money is security.
 If you live paypacket to paypacket, you're always in fear of losing your job and can't quit no matter how bad things get. Even a little money acts as a cushion against redundancy or quitting to find a better job or retrain for one.
 
 Money is freedom. 
 If you rely on others, whether it's an employer (salary / wages), the government (benefits / UBI), or followers / fans (patreon etc.), for you financial security then you don't have financial security. You need have enough money to not need anything else to be truly free of expectations and demands on your time, and to not have any worries.
 
 Money is a means to an end.
 Money lets you live where you want (a Scottish castle? a Tony Stark Malibu beach house? or just a log cabin in the Highlands?) and have the lifestyle you want (partying in the Med? private jets to exotic islands? or just videogaming 24/7 because you can?)",2.5
"My father retired from 30 years in the Air Force and is still working, he is the hardest working person I have ever met. He is also fueled by his work, it really gives him some deep satisfaction. I don__t think he is interested in being fully retired. On one hand I can understand this and would want to stay busy and involved in projects that interested me. But on the other, I do really love to disconnect and explore the world and other interests. If I could retire and just travel around and do all my hobbies, I think I would be so happy. But I also wouldn__t mind a flexible job that let me do that, and then work a few days a week or something. I think I like the idea of retirement as allowing you to choose what you want to do __¡° if you want to continue working, you can. If you want to stop and just relax, you can do that too. To me, it is a time for not grinding yourself down with work and enjoying other things in life.",3
"Oh man. The fact that in the United States you cannot collect social security until you're 62 is just bull. Especially because the American culture just works you to death. We don't often get long vacations. Two weeks vacation seems to be the norm here. And then you're made to feel guilty for taking off. So, you work HARD all of your life, barely taking off then you can't retire until at least 62? Nonsense. I really wish more people talked about retirement and investing. I wish it was taught in school. I am working on teaching myself about investing and retirement because I'll be damned if I work til I'm 62. Then what happens if I work until I am 62 then I have a health condition(s) and can't enjoy my retirement anyway? I feel like retiring so late is a sham. You always hear people say ""when I retire I'm going to...."". Why the hell do we have to wait until we retire to do XYZ? I just lost a friend in November who worked his entire life and wasn't retired. He was waiting to retire so he could do XYZ and unfortunately he didn't get to. I feel like retirement is also this thing people talk about but we (as a society) really don't know how to go about retiring or save for retirement. I feel like often times people wait until they're about 1-10 years out from retirement until they start thinking about it or try to plan for it. If we start thinking about it and planning for it while we're younger we might have more money for our retirement. I think the retirement age should be lower, as well. By the time I can retirement the retirement age will be like 75, I swear! Ha!",3
"I don__t think I will retire in the conventional sense and don__t plan to.
 
 Retirement is too ___all or nothing__ - from work to no work - which is too much of a jolt to the system for me. 
 
 I think it is outdated too. It is assuming that people beyond a certain age have nothing to contribute to the business/corporate world. It is a loss of skills and expertise. 
 
 Even the name feels negative to me ___re-tire__ and when I say the word it does not have a positive tone, like ___tiring__ ___tire__ and ___tired__ is just not enticing or something I would want to do. 
 
 Why don__t we give the option where people approaching the traditional retirement age get to have a session with a skilled person who can show them all the options open to them?
 
 Why don__t we have consultancies full of retirees to contract hire? (Actually, I know someone doing this in Austria)
 
 Why don__t we find ways for people at the traditional retirement age and in the run up to this age, to explore their talents and strengths?
 
 My plan for the age when people traditionally retire is to start some businesses, or maintain the ones I will have at that age and do some really experimental stuff. 
 
 I think it is the right age to be ___whatever, I want to try it__. Maybe I would start a perfume house then? Who knows___..",2.5
"I am scared for my retirement. It seems so far away and yet like something that I don__t have the same benefits as my parents and grandparents to enjoy relatively stress-free. It__s something I am forced to think about now and yet I have no idea where to start. By all accounts, I can see myself working well into my 70s if health allows me, but will the stress and anxiety of saving enough for my retirement make me an absolute frazzled mess by the time I get there!? I want to be able to enjoy my twilight years without worrying about whether I can heat my home or have to rely on children to care for me. I would absolutely hate to be a burden on loved ones and want to feel financially secure when I reach retirement but it doesn__t seem like a realistic possibility right now. There__s no way to save with any real interest and so it seems futile to even try at the moment, especially with the cost of living going up by the second. It__s all quite depressing really, I don__t know how I__m going to be able to provide any kind of financial foundation to my own son, let alone think about myself and partner and how we__re going to fare on our own.",4
"I am in a fortunate position where the concept of FIRE (well the RE element specifically) could materialise within the next 5 years. So financially, retiring is a possibility sooner rather than later and does factor into my thoughts (the ISA > SIPP > Company pension > State pension bridge is well beyond foundation level). But you'd be bored senseless, right? Most of my friends would still be working - I used to work in retail and remember well a Tuesday off, with little to do and nobody to see! I also like some structure, some challenge, some purpose - so realistically I'd transfer from full-time 'career' work to something else. A passion project? Community work? Maybe still some consulting or project work? Who knows at this stage... and because I might not reach it (I might hit by a bus tomorrow or not live long into any retirement - I've seen this happen all too often), I'm still going to enjoy life while I'm on my way there. That might push the date of 'retirement' further out, but that's fine. Retirement is just another phase, it's not a destination in and of itself. If I can get to the point where I can 'retire' then I guess I'll just have some extra optionality - even if I don't immediately use it.",3
"I am looking forward to one day retiring, though I am not sure if the traditional idea of retirement is right for me. I can see myself giving up my full-time job, but I'm pretty sure I would still want to work in some capacity. Instead of having to work to earn a paycheck, though, I could work doing something that I love (probably related to the outdoors), and would not have to worry about the monetary aspect. Outside of part-time work, I could also see myself doing a lot of volunteering, traveling the world, and spending time with my family. In summary, as long as I continue to keep busy and spend time with loved ones, I think retirement will be quite enjoyable. I have a lot of work left to do to save up enough money to retire, but I am hopeful it will happen.",2
"Retirement can be one or more of many things:
 
 - A scary, poor time
 If you don't have enough money you'll be scrimping and saving for eating and heating and having a miserable time.
 
 - A lonely time
 Without chatting to colleagues on a regular basis, it's easy to become isolated. And as you get older, more friends move away or even die.
 
 - A meaningless time
 Many people gain a sense of purpose through work. Take the work away, and they don't have a sense of meaning in their lives.
 
 - A time of freedom
 With a pension and an decent level of savings and investments, you can do what you want on your own timetable! No bosses, no meetings, just your own caprice. See the kids / grandkids. Go travelling. Take up some new hobbies!
 
 - A time to follow your passion
 You can work on the things you want to work on. With a reasonable pension, you can take risks you couldn't before as you've a secure source of income. You might find you earn more money from a hobby in retirement than you could as a wageslave during your ""working life""!
 
 I'm really hoping my retirement is one or more of those last three!",2.5
"Hello, how are you? I'm Lou it's nice to meet you. I'm here with my husband Matt, were both civil servants. I've been living in London for the past decade now and I work as a civil servant. I dont know what I do with myself, time just flies by! We've just got back from holiday and we have another couple lined up over the year. We're still going to weddings too - I thought they'd have ended by now. It's actually been a lot of fun, it's much nice to just have a few rather than 9 in the year. I've just started tap classes, I love it but I'm not very good. And I've joined a couple of cookbook clubs too which has been really interesting, it's been lovely to meet some like minded people and just talk about food for a whole night.",3

We recently won a Big Lottery grant to help change the mindset of over 50s, currently unemployed, to discover new pathways to employment.

"I've never really thought about that! Theres pros and cons really. Its costing jobs I'm sure which is never ok. I'm a feminist, I do a lot of work in that area and if the high street dies then its costing predominantly women their livelihoods and I'm honestly not sure what would replace that as a flexible hours working alternative. I also think it's sad for older people too as they rely on face to face contact a lot of the time for company and clarity - my dad is 68 and cannot so much as turn on a computer. He has no desire to do so and I dont think he's alone. He looks so lost whenever i try to show him so it would be very sad for him and his generation if options were taken away - i dont think hed cope.
 
 I use digital services a lot though and it's made my life a lot easier. Our weekly food shops comes from online, I do a lot of clothes shopping online. (I recently went shopping on oxford street and the experience was horrendous.) I love the convenience of trying things on in my own home.
 
 I use online.banking almost exclusively. I love that it's so easy these days to log in - I use my thumb print and my transactions are done and dusted within the minute.
 
 I'm not convinced by the digitisation of health. I think a lot of trackers produce anxiety and we're losing touch with ourselves and our bodies as a result. I dont need to see how my sleep was if I wake up tired. It's also somehow commoditising sleep! I mean, my God! However I love apps like clue that track your periods, for the first time in my life I'm understanding my PMS. I occasionally use the steps tracker more our of interest than anything. I know I need to get more exercise though- I can feel it in my body when I've had enough and when I need to get out there.",3
"Its excellent. We no longer need to wait for appointments, can self service any time, save time on commuting and track all appointments.",1.5
"Generally, I feel pretty good about this; it's inevitable in my opinion. I worry that not enough is being done to make websites/apps accessible so that they're easy for everyone to use. I see how so many of my friends 50+ and family struggle to navigate websites, becoming increasingly frustrated. I also think that banks, especially, need to do more to create trust online and to accept that for those in the later stages of life, they just want an offline experience and they're going to need to deal with that.",2
"I find this a tough one. One day I worked out that the first thing I interacted with was a self service check out machine and the last thing was touching out with my Oyster card on the tube. I feel like my behaviour is not being ""normalised"" because I am interacting with a machines and tech too much. When I am having a bad day no one is keeping me in check as much as they used to. I do feel health and wellness and food really need a human touch because human interaction and interaction with nature keeps us grounded, connected and sane. However, for things like banking which don't need a human touch because there is no positive association or connection with it on a day to day basis. Interacting with my current account does not spark joy in the same way meditation and yoga does.",2
My weekly shop,1
My doctor is online- Babylon. It's so easy. I used to have to wait a week for an appointment and move other commitments around. I can now book an appointment in 5 mins time!,2
"Banking is the big one for me. I use my Barclays and First Direct apps on almost a daily basis and can count on one hand how often I have gone into my branch in the past year. I absolutely love being able to review my account, transfer money to friends and family, all at a glance. Honestly, it's transformative for me to do all this so easily. Barclays especially seems to have really grasped digital banking in a way the other banks do not seem to.",2
"I am 100% digital on banking, switching from HSBC to N2, because it allows me to constantly track and balance my spending. I get no unexpected bills because of this switch, makes doing my taxes easier and it makes me thinking about my spending in an empowered way, so digital makes my life more stress free.",2
Convenience. We dont have a car and it's easier for us to get it delivered,1.5
"Save on commuting, no waiting in waiting rooms, able to have an appointment even when I'm at work.",2
"Terrific user experience, convenience and neccessity. With so many branches of my local bank closed, there really wasn't any other option.",2
"I think everyone is digital in banking these days, but the beauty of N26 compared to HSBC is that it is the bank for digital nomads like me so it is more of a lifestyle banking account. I don't get charged as much when I withdraw from foreign bank accounts and I get perks for my lifestyle e.g. discounts on airport lounge and free co-working days at WeWork.",3
I'd be able to see real time stock and select date codes,1.5
Be able to choose my doctor.,1
"Well, some of the services can be inconsistent on the app. Like viewing statements, as an example. It often doesn't work. It would be good to see more transactions then just the past month if requested. It's good when it comes to the past 30 days of transactions but not so great beyond that. Would be good to be able to export or email previous statements from the app.",1.5
"I would love it if I could pay for one banking monthly fee that included wifi and cloud storage - a complete nomad package. Also, if they gave me a free power bank",2
"We should be using tech to take the stretch out. Booking appointments online rather than calling up your gp would be so helpful and I currently cant do that. Likewise for getting my test results. 
 
 I often have phone consultations with a dr - would love it we could do that online so they can see me and I could show symptoms. 
 
 For ordering prescriptions that would be helpful online. 
 
 And in part some diagnosis would be helpful in advance -could I be filling out my symptoms ahead of the appointment for the dr to read ahead of time.
 
 I also have a reoccurring condition - digital services to help that would be terrific. Anything to stop me needing to try and get an appointment that could get me treated sooner would be so helpful. Theres something I net in my genetic makeup that makes me predisposed to this- I'd love to know because at the moment it feels like we just treat symptoms not the cause. Digi health could help for sure.",3
"Fantastic. Shorter waiting times, quicker appointments, able to see a GP anytime.",1.5
"I'm aware of NHS apps such as Babylon, for instance, and I did have an app I deleted a while back to schedule an appointment with my local GP. I also have tried CBT online briefly but found it too basic to meet my needs. I have considered moving to Babylon but didn't want to lose the ability to consult my GP which was what was required. It all seems a bit all or nothing to me which is only going to appeal to someone in circumstances where not having a relationship with a local GP is not a big deal.",2
I think digital in healthcare is so mixed and lagging. I can book appointments online but I can't get test results online. It is also not connected. I recently got a prescription but at the pharmacy the medication was out of stock and discontinued. It seems like the healthcare service is out of synch and not seamless online.,2
"I use Baylon health. Brilliant. I booked an appointment for 10 minutes time, had the consultation in a Starbucks then found my prescription ready for me at the chemist. 0 waiting time.",2
I used an app to schedule my appointments with my GP and view them. I often forgot my login and it didn't seem that much more convenient than just ringing the GP so I eventually deleted it.,2
"Only meditation apps like calm, which are good because they fit into my lifestyle and are bitesized. I am also tracking my steps because the nurse told me to get into shape - I ate all the cookies :-) I have used sleep trackers in the past but they made me more anxious and more of an insomniac because I became obsessed with tracking my data and a bit of a data junkie.",2.5
"Yes definitely! Answers are in.the answer to my last question about why. I'd love the tools to be able to make simple diagnosis.
 
 The drawback is, if you think you need medical help and are denied you'd feel unheard. Drs often perform their greatest service just by listening, comforting and reassuring. Would we lose that? I also get my vitals done when I visit the dr so would miss that because things have been picked up on the back of it that I haven't know about or presented with symptoms. 
 
 I feel like to embed it, its shouldn't be that you are dictated to but a choice .is offered. For example we dont think you need to see the dr. Are you happy with that outcome or would you like an appointment?",3
Yes I already use Babylon.,1
"Yes, I probably would. I don't currently have a huge desire to visit the GP's surgery but don't want to completely lose the ability to attend my local surgery either. So a digital health tool that gave me flexibility around that I would consider using.",2
"Absolutely! There is a 2 week wait for my GPs at home and I travel a lot. I would appreciate this for all the things I should go to the doctors for but don't because I don't want to spend 1 hour travelling and 1 hour in an appointment, especially if there is a risk of me travelling last minute or cancelling.",2
"My relationship with money has evolved from a source of stress and anxiety to a tool to protect myself and my future. I never knew how to approach money or how to make it work for me, but after reading ""I Will Teach You To Be Reach"" by Ramit Sethi, I have completely transformed my view on money and now feel more comfortable saving, investing and also spending!",2
"Hmm... has my approach evolved? Unfortunately I am still an impulsive spender. I don__t mean that in the sense that I buy a bunch of crap I don__t need, but I__ll buy things in the moment instead of thinking about saving that money. A lot of that has to do with my live for the now mindset, however I do think I__ve evolved slightly because I__m more aware of ___investment__ spending. I recently bought a digital camera which set me back a bit financially, but I knew over time it would make me more money through creative work. Not only am I considering purchases that can enhance my career, I__m also reevaluating renting my home vs. buying. I feel that my approach to money is maturing more rapidly once I turned 30. (I am now 32.)",2.5
"It all has started with money as something we must have to survive in the society. When I was young, witnessed my parents went to work almost everyday to get things done for money to buy things that we need without questioning about it or explaining in a deeper sense. Of course I have followed that path for a while until I have realized that is a broader concept of value exchange. My social circle is so small so that seems to have a few value exchanging methods. Because we value full stomach and we are lazy or don't want to grow food, so we need money to exchange for quicker feeling full, since we value the same thing and come up with how to negotiate with illusional numbers of price tag. I would like to see the future full of diverse form of values wether it's fiat, paper, digital art piece, gold bar, a pair of socks, pickle__¡è¡§, basketball dunk moment, or time__¡è¡±. They all can be transacted to each other. We all value different things so why we stick to only a few types of money while today's technology can help facilitate the value diversity that can technically be exchanged? __¡§",4
"My approach to money has evolved in that I try to be more mindful of my spending instead of just swiping my credit card. I have decreased the amount of which I order take out. I have become more frugal and try to reduce my waste and single use items. I have really been trying to take advantage of credit card offers ie: rotating 5% back categories, travel credit card bonuses, etc. I have also started saving for my wedding (I'm engaged) and for vacations. In terms of my money evolving- I would like to eventually use a spread sheet or a paid version of a spreadsheet software so I can manage my money and see exactly where all of my money is going. For example- I would like to know that I am spending X amount of money on food, takeout, household supplies, gasoline, medical bills, etc. I would also like to open an IRA and start investing long term in the stock market- such as an index fund.",2.5
"My approach to money over the years has been more day to day / month to month and less concerned with the future. Honestly, it is a bit late, but the pandemic and maybe turning 30 soon is making me reconsider my lifestyle / career choice and I'm defintely worrying and planning more for the future. Throughout my twenties, savings and investments were barely on my radar and honestly not even a possibility given that I worked mostly in freelance gigs in fashion (aka not getting paid well) and living in very expensive cities (NYC and Paris.) I may not having a super strong savings or investment strategy but at least I don't have debt. My parents really instilled in me a great fear of debt. This fear combined with my often inconsistent work really taught me how to keep my expenses as low as possible. And with every expense, I made sure that I was at least accruing something (ideally points and not debt) with each purchase or payment, I played the game and worked the US credit card system. I used to love traveling like crazy and I would pay for it all in airline miles and credit card points! Going forward, I would like to feel more like a ""real adult"" when it comes to my finances. I currently feel dumb and like I don't know what I'm doing, like somehow everyone else understands these systems better than me. I want to be more organized with my finances and more educated about how to manage them (investing, better understanding payment plans, managing my taxes better, etc.) I want to have normal / practical things like a retirement plan or to be able to save up to buy an apartment one day, but these things seem very out of my reach. Mostly, I would just like to feel like I know what I am doing!",3
"Haha- sadly i feel it has evolved with age- more fear around spending and therefore more saving. Where would I like it to go? i want to be able to invest my money in socially responsible projects/banks. I have so little trust in financial institutions to be morally, socially and environmentally responsible it actually breaks my heart. I want to break down and deconstruct my own relationship with money more- to challenge myself, to look at generosity and equality and the environment and not be worried about being taken for a ride when I put my money somewhere. If that makes sense. I want to have a more value driven relationship with money and for it to be something that isn't taboo any more.",2.5
"Venmo is one of my favorite brands and has definitely created positivity around my relationship with money. It is such an incredible tool to transfer and request money and also, keep track of what you have transferred out or into your account. I now have a detailed log of the money I spent, and Venmo is a very useful tool to keep track of my money and spending.",2
"I__m not sure what type of brand you__re looking for specifically, i.e. consumer products, but one company I__ve grown fond of is Poshmark, which is a reselling app. It__s been interesting and somewhat financially educational to purge personal items and make money off of them. Not only do I love the extra income, but it__s wonderful to promote secondhand spending instead of perpetuating companies who may not be economically ethical.",3
Celsius Network,1
I think Chase has had a positive impact on my relationship with money,1
"Intuit Mint (formerly mint.com) - this is just a personal finance app that I have been using for the past few years. I mostly use it as a budget planner and a way to track my spending. What I like most about it is that I can link multiple accounts and have all of my finances in one place, rather than jumping from bank to bank or working in an excel sheet. It is just a nice and visual overview of all your accounts. There is also a bill tracking function so I can make sure I am on top of all of my upcoming payments. I think this app has given me a better sense of what my spending habits are and it helps me balance my accounts better. I at least get the illusion of being somewhat organized with this app!",2.5
"This is tricky- what does that mean- a positive impact on my relationship with money? Part of me wants to say ethical clothing brands such as birdsong- who have highlighted how horrific fast fashion is and how little a wage is paid to the people who make so many of our clothes- it has made me totally reassess how i spend my money in terms of clothing- I don't want to spend money to benefit some ceo- I want to support locak craftspeople and to know where my money is going. I now only buy second hand or from ethical clothing makers- which means i now spend much more on clothes, but I but much less so my actual spending probably evens out but I feel much happier about what i am doing with my money",3
"Instagram has the most negative impact on my relationship with money. It is constantly showing me items I may be interested in purchasing and makes it incredibly easy to do it through the app. It is showing me items that I may purchase out of impulse, which is something that I am trying to avoid.",2
"This is the obvious opposite to what I just stated above, which is fast fashion companies. Although I do order and enjoy a couple items, I tend to do this awful thing where I buy just enough to get free shipping, which ends up not being so affordable after all and I get a few items I didn__t really need or want in the first place. Examples of these sites would be Nasty Gal, Boohoo, Shein, etc.",2
Grab,1
I think Amazon has had a negative impact on my relationship with money,1
"Apple - My relationship to Apple is a dysfunctional one at best. Apple keeps treating me like crap, but I never leave! I feel trapped by Apple. But I also feel like I am in too deep with Apple, we have too much history. Apple has me exactly where they want me - I don't ever want to use a PC ever again! Maybe this is more of a love / hate thing but they are just so expensive and (often) badly made, but I keep throwing my money at them...I find the whole situation frustrating. I hate seeing Apple constantly doing screwy things to squeeze more money from people all the time. It is mean design, like changing the chargers all the time so that your old ones are not compatible with the new models. I just hate companies that seem to design products to fail so that you are forced to replace them frequently. I think in terms of my relationship to money Apple makes me feel like I can't work without it so I'm just bound to it and forced to pay a crazy amount.",3
"HSBC. Finding out about how they were funding arms-trade, nuclear weapons, fracking etc. It makes me feel physically a bit sick, but when i've looked into other more ethical banks such as co-op..I've heard stories of them not paying their staff the living wage- the whole banking sector feels so so problematic in terms of ethics. How does this impact my relationship with money? I think it stops me investing, it makes me fear that financial institutions are there to exploit or for greed. It doesn't make me feel like money is a force for social good and change, which is ideally what I would like in my relationship with money.",3.5
I am looking towards retirement and beyond.,1
"For me, since I__m very live-for-now, I don__t do a great job planning for the future. I do think about the future, and what I would like in a year or two, but I don__t align my finances to those dreams. I do think I am slowly evolving, and when the time is right I will start being more intentional with savings and investments.",2
"Onwards from now, I'm looking forward to this moment to the very far future. I feel that new form of money is happening right now, at least, so much different than past hundred or thousand years(like gold). Cryptocurrency has opened my mind a lot when I paid things with it and it worked. It made me realized the concept practically that I just exchanged my value to another value of another party. That's it. They don't need to know what I paid with, they just got what they want. So that could be anything. I believe people will have more options to choose when it comes to money. No matter what they choose, it will work. It's different from the past that we have only a few options to choose such as cash, cards, gold, numbers, cows, rocks. I'm good with the feeling of more freedom of choice, will be happy to exchange things for what I value.",3
from next week to 30+ years,1
"Previously I was very month to month. Now I'm trying to set myself up to be more year to year. I want to get to the point where I am planning retirement and more distant goals, but I'm not really there yet.",2
Probably 5 years. Saving for buying a houseboat maybe- a space closer to nature to live.,2
"Financial security means spending money on things I love while not spending money on things I do not. For example, if I love traveling I would like to be able to travel and spend as much money as I want on that trip without thinking twice on how much I am spending. If I do not like or care about my home and having the most extravagant home, I do not need to spend a lot on that and have the money to have the best furniture or the largest house.",2
"Financial security is a fickle b*tch to me. As a freelancer, I can feel secure for a few months and then extremely insecure for a few months. The unsteady income is incredibly stressful, but clearly I like what I do and take the risk otherwise I would do something more reliable. As of right now, the idea of being financially secure would mean owning a house, and having a monetary cushion in case of slow work months.",2.5
"It means in different ways. Firstly, it makes me think of not seriously thinking about finance in a daily basis because deep down, I know that everything is under control financially. If anything happens whether it's intentional or not, I can secure it with my finance management, with ease. That thinking leads to the second part which is practical actions such as savings, personal finance management, investment, calculation, and so on to feel confident about it. Oh that will loop to the first! __¡± Think about it until no need to think about it! __¡ì So I can enjoy what matters more. For me personally, I have fun when thinking of finance as well, experimenting with numbers, so it could be my hobby part (what matters more) and also surviving part(need to do to live well or prevent from life difficulty). It would be much greater if I can have financial security for wider circle as family, friends, society, and the world which means I would be much confident to share, to secure, to provide knowledge, to help with such ""secure"" feeling. __¡¯_Financial security could be an important fundamental element for this modern world to move on to something more meaningful in people lives when we don't need to do things just only for money in mind. There are so many more to explore, to develop, to enjoy, and actually to live with.",3.5
"Financial security is a very broad range for me. In the short term- it means being able to pay my bills (without having to ___rob Pete to pay Paul__), going out to eat (or ordering take out) and feeling like you can treat yourself here and there. It also means not having to put back certain groceries because you can__t afford them. Financial security, for me, also includes not having a feeling of panic if something breaks in my home. I want to know that I can pay for it. I am not talking about paying for a new A/C system right out of pocket but I am talking more about appliances, hot water heater, faucet, etc. Financial security also includes being able to put things on 0% interest credit cards because my credit is solid. Financial security also includes being able to enjoy some indulgences once in a while- which may include getting your nails done, getting a massage, going to a nice restaurant and even vacations once a year and/or shorter weekend rips throughout the year. Financial security down the road for me looks like being able to retire by having enough in a retirement account. While my current job does have a retirement system in place, I would still like to open my own- such as an IRA and incest in index funds. All in all, financial security, to me, feels like not being anxious about money. I think I will always be frugal but being financially secure means not having to panic, ask family members to borrow money or let bills go over due while being able to ___enjoy life a little__.",3
"Financial security to me is knowing that if something goes wrong, or there is an accident, or I lose my job, or whatever, that I will be ok. That I'll have some cushion with which I can support myself and hopefully my loved ones as well. Financial security to me is just being prepared. I had never felt a huge need to own something but recently I've been thinking that I'd maybe like to have some property so that if I really needed to do so, I could sell the apartment or house, or rent it out and give myself an income. That might make me feel ""safe"" or more secure financially.",2
"It means knowing my money is safe and there if I need it....it means having enough to cover my day-to-day living without having to be worried about if I have enough, knowing if I had to stop work for a few months I would be able to survive financially.",2
"I am self employed working to tight deadlines. I am paid to come up with creative marketing solutions which creates a lot of pressure. I also have a super active social life, so boosting my productivity and creativity is a challenge.
",2
"I run multiple businesses and travel constantly so need to creative and productive to keep my busineses afloat and sustain my lifestyle.
",1.5
"I feel like my creativity is the lifeline of my personal existence. I've found that when I have put myself in positions where I wasn't being creative, I've been extremely unhappy so now as I get older I make a conscious effort to balance my creative output within my day-to-day life.Hence the reason productivity is important to me is equally important. I know that if I have to balance my day between work that isn't as creative, as long as I remain productive on that work and get it to a place where I can still focus on my creative pursuits, I tend to fair well mentally and emotionally.
",3
"I am a freelance writer, and I write creatively in my spare time. Being productive is important for my freelance work, and creativity is important in both my freelancing and my recreational writing.
",2
"Creativity is a huge part of my life. I am an actress, musician and writer, but I also do other jobs to help pay the bills. This can mean that sometimes by the time I sit down to create something, I feel too worn out from the days work already. I need that boost to get me in the mood and get me started on something.
",2
"As a fashion photographer, I always need to come up with new ideas for my shootings. I can't just do the same thing over and over again, otherwise my clients will run away. I have to be able to find new places to shoot, new poses for my models, new people to work with, and sometimes I feel that I'm not creative enough, or that I'm doing the same kind of pictures again and again. Talking about productivity, as a freelancer there are times when I have more work (having more shootings means having to spend more time taking pictures, but also more time editing all the photos later), and I always feel that I won't be able to finish all the work in time.
",2.5
My work requires sitting at a computer for most of the day. Procrastination is especially easy and it can be hard to maintain focus for extended periods.,2
"I have low energy levels and I need 8 hours worth of sleep. There are only so many hours in the day and I want to maximise this. Also, the friends I am surrounded with are super nice but not many are inspiring. The ones who are super human are hardly ever free.",2.5
"As I said, for my creativity the biggest challenge is to always find new ideas, and these ideas should be good enough to keep my clients, and myself, satisfied.
 Regarding the productivity, the thing that bothers me the most is not having more time, because I'm in a point where I feel that I have a good workflow, but I guess there are always new methods that could help me to increase my productivity.",3
"Time- there is never enough time. And it I do have time, I tend to fill it with more ventures! Also time differences, my businesses are on opposite sides of the world- Australia and UK- so I need to be on call 24/7",2
"The main challenge is not being able to focus on my creative endeavors full time yet. I still have a ""day job"" that facilitates my living expenses but once I can get my creative work to a place that it can sustain me I'll be good.",2
"Sometimes it's tiredness from a days work. Sometimes I have writers block and all the good intentions in the world can't get those first words down. Or I hit a stumbling block when writing a song and can't get past the verse, or see where it could go next musically. These things can then lead to frustration which is never a helpful feeling when trying to create something!",3
LSD Microdosing,3
"I listen to ""subliminals"" focused on productivity, focus and energy while I work to try and reset and program my mind. I also listen to NLP recordings as well to try to reprogram my mind and the language I use.",3
"I boost my creativity by spending a lot of time looking at what others photographers and artists are doing, but also watching films, attending exhibitions... Anything that can bring new ideas to my head.
 To boost my productivity, I just have to take hours from sleep. Its the only way to do more when I have times with a lot of work. To stay awake, I normally drink something with caffeine, like Coca-Cola. Since I don't drink coffee on a daily basis, drinking something with caffeine helps. I try to avoid energy drinks because of a bad experience I had one time with them.
 Another thing that I'm trying now is to change my eating habits. It's a method that a friend explained to me. During the times with the biggest workload, I concentrate my eating hours during the afternoon, let's say between 4pm and 8pm. During these hours I can eat whatever I want, but nothing during the rest of the day. That way your productivity and focusing levels increase during the mornings especially, but also along the whole day.",3
"Very loud music, cold room temperature, coffee and coconut water, bright lights, lots of exercise and working on multiple tasks simultaneously (eg cooking, cleaning, exercising,working on my laptop and chatting to friends simultaneously.",2
"I usually listen to podcasts that apply to what it is I'm doing creatively to keep my mind in that space. I've been listening to How I made It and Questlove's podcast. This allows me usually to multitask at my day job and keep my creative mind going. Also, I download an app called iMPC on the iPhone that allows me to work on my music production wherever I'm at and save it my main workstation so I can get home and finish it.",2
"My favourite tactic is to get up and have a cup of coffee without any food. While I'm drinking my coffee I check emails and do a bit of life admin and then by the time the caffeine kicks in I'm ready to begin with the boost from the coffee and no other distractions. I ride the high of the coffee and lack of food until I get hungry and then after eating I get a second, calmer wave of focus.
 If it's later in the day I find sometimes taking myself away from the task at hand and focussing on something simple like going on a run or cooking can really help get some distance and perspective and take the pressure off.
 If it's music that I'm writing then I sometimes find it useful to play older songs or other peoples music to get my head in the right space.",2
Heard about it through social media.,1.5
"Desperation - I was late on my deadlines and really unfocused. I had tried turning my phone off; putting cold water on my face/having a cold shower; working naked (yes, it works); and taking pro plus tablets. None of them had worked.",2
"I'm doing this method of concentrating my eating hours because a friend of mine who's also a photographer is doing it and he said that it works for him very well.
 Since it doesn't imply eating or drinking anything that's not on my diet, I thought that I could give it a try.",2
"I find if I keep busy, do multiple things simultaneously that are different in nature and don't stop then I keep my energy levels up and actually get more energised. Doing one task at a time- or only one type of task- becomes monotonous and tiring.",2
Just the idea that if I use my time wisely I can still remain creatively sharp even if I'm not doing creative work at the moment.,2
"It sort of naturally evolved! I started taking days off work a year or two ago to focus specifically on my own creativity as I found I wasn't giving myself time to work on anything. When I first started out I wasted a lot of time procrastinating. My routine of coffee with no food, followed by some food later on for a second burst developed over time and now feels very comfortable and reliable. I suppose it was trial and error and after a while I started to notice that this particular combination really helps.",3
The main thing is a reduction in procrastination. I become more interested in my work and it's easier to avoid distractions. Everything just seems a little bit more interesting and I'm more keen to get stuck in to work.,3
I know it is working because I am tracking my hours with Toggl and since doing this I am achieving more per hour. I am more calm and focused. I am much much happier.,3
"Right now I'm only in the first days of trying this, so I can't say for sure if it helps me or not.
 For now, I'm only feeling hungry in the mornings, because my body still have to adapt. 
 Waking up has been easier though, and of course I don't spend time in the morning preparing and eating breakfast or lunch.",2
I push through fatigue and feel more energised. I am able to focus and get through work quicker.,3
I know for a fact because I don't feel any regrets about not being able to work on my own creative projects. As long as I'm not just wasting time I can utilize moments of down time that I may have to switch mental gears.,1.5
"The difference is clear to me. If I don't follow the routine then I get easily distracted by a million other things...cleaning the house, my phone, playing with my cats. With the way I do things, I get all the distractions out of the way while I'm drinking the coffee and I've learnt to time it right so that when the positive burst of energy comes from the caffeine, I'm in prime position with all the other distractions taken care of, or indulgences satisfied. It's not bulletproof...my cats are very cute and distracting! But it's enough to give me a chance to get in the zone.",2
"I guess microdosing is a bit of a hack! LSD has not really been used for this purpose for most of its existence. People associate it with tripping or zoning you out. But tiny doses can make everything a little brighter, everything a little more interesting, help those creative impulses come to the surface.",3
"I use lots of vitamin supplements as a drink in the morning and at lunchtime. The ones I use are designed for people who are sick with colds. 
 
 I am often ""worked up"" and over anxious in the morning, but I need my morning coffee to power through the morning. So, if I have too much caffeine, I have a Lemsip to calm me down and stay focused. 
 
 I meditate every morning for 5-13 minutes specifically to focus and boost my productivity. 
 
 I sometimes work naked. (Don't ask!) I just feel that more things flow to me when I do this. 
 
 In the past I was a massive pro plus addict so I am reluctant to take things like speed because I already have enough vices.",3
"I don't use medicines or other substances to improve my focusing and boosting my productivity. I've had a bad experience with one of these products during my university years, so I avoid them totally.",2
I use ondansetron for hangovers (you are supposed to inject in a drip to control nausea for chemo patients- I drink it) I use hemorrhoid cream under eyes to reduce puffiness and signs of fatigue,2
I've been drinking monster energy drinks and also taking testosterone boosts that I get from the health store.,3
"My go to coffee is Taylors of Harrogate, the praline especial beans. I use an Aeropress to make my coffee and also grind the beans at home, I find the whole process very enjoyable, it is an important part of the routine.
 I've certainly used Diaoralyte for help with a hangover but not to help with focus.",2.5
"I wouldn't share my microdosing with everyone, but I'm a privileged person so I don't have much to fear from telling people about it.",2
"Being naked and the lemsip mentioned above
 
 Sometimes I tie myself to my desk to prevent me moving. It is weird but it works. 
 
 It is terrible but I am also a sugar junkie. I consume sweets to help me power through the evening to meet deadlines. Then I crash so I eat more sweets creating a crash and burn cycle. I sometimes add paracetomol to mellow me out and caffeinated drinks. 
 
 I also try to fast for one day a week. I have heard this is a great way to ""reset"" your system and I must admit I feel that I have a lot more energy after doing this (and it is saving me money). A friend of mine is big on mindfulness and advised me to do a ""rest"" day of no food, caffeine, only water once a week. He reckons this is the reason why he has more energy and, to be honest, he does look heaIthier. 
 
 I studied toxicology at University, so I know how to push the limits without causing longer term damage. 
 
 I would like to exercise more, but find that yoga is the only thing that really fits into my lifestyle at the moment. 
 
 Another thing I do is take regular maps - around 2 of 5 minutes a day - and at one point I was sleeping in two 4 hour batches. This really does help me stay focus and it breaks up the day, which is great. I would like to experiment more with my sleep patterns to see if I can find a better way of sleeping. I am not entirely convinced that sleeping for 7-8 hours straight is the optimum for me, or anyone for that matter.",3
"Like I said in the previous answer, during my time at university, I took one substance (I can't remember the name or what it was right now) offered to me by a classmate to help me through the exams, but it gave me a bad reaction and I had to stay home with a stomach ache for a few days.
 Since then I haven't taken anything like that to help my creativity/productivity.",2
Have tried Modafinil and No Doz to stay awake- No Doz got me through uni.,2
I smoke a strain of weed called girl scout cookies that usually keeps me alert and the high makes me think even more creatively.,3
I find sex can be helpful...nothing like an orgasm to help calm and focus the mind!,2.5
"LSD is like nothing else. I've had experiences with it that have changed my life, and that's an understatement. Microdosing seemed like a logical next step in order to get in touch with the powerful effects of LSD.",3
"The accepted methods are not working for me. I have tried waking up at 4 am, planning my life etc. I always end up over-planning and feeling like a failure if I can't meet my expectations. Now, I like to focus on small hacks that are easy for me to implement and super low lift.",3
I don't like too much caffeine and I'm not interested in any harder drugs or chemicals. So I feel this method is the safest and most natural for me.,2
A release. The build up of excitement and tension followed by a huge rush of warmth and pleasure. I find I'm much less distracted afterwards and I find it easier to concentrate.,3
"Ideally I wouldn't have to microdose. I would be able to turn my creativity off and on. I don't like the thought of depending on a substance, and I know that there are many issues with relying on psychedelics for answers or 'getting an edge'. 
 
 This is why I try to cultivate practices that will replace microdosing. Meditation, yoga, lucid dreaming, nature relatedness. The idea is that I can grow my capacity to enter a creative state on my own, without having to ingest a substance (no matter how small it is). It will take work, but I think it will make me healthier.",4
"I am really missing having endless energy. I really struggle to do more than a 10 hour day. This is not because I want to become a work-a-holic, but because I am starting a side business while freelancing full-time. Part of my lack of energy is diet and exercise. I do rely on caffeine and sugar to fuel my productive spurts when I am trying to hit a tight deadline this has resulted in me having cycles of sugar highs and sugar lows.",2.5
"I would need something that helps me stay awake for some hours stolen from sleeping time, without making me feel like shit when I wake up in the morning. Because it's a bit useless to be productive at night if when I wake up again I can't work with the same intensity.",2.5
More focus,1.5
More time. Once I'm able to shift entirely to the creative work my output will enhance,2
I would like to be able to turn off the ability to procrastinate! Also turn off the self doubt which can be crippling when you are trying to make something. If there was a way to guarantee absolute productivity with focus and creativity then it would be irresistible!...But then everyone would be doing it and it would be too easy!,2.5
"I don't have much understanding of it. I have a PhD in regenerative medicine and I'm mostly skeptical about these buzzwords. But I know some people are experimenting with nootropics and various different ways of changing your sleep patterns and diet. I think there's definitely a lot of reason to consider your body and mind in a very holistic way, which seems to be what a lot of the 'biohacking' movement is doing. However I think it can very easily slip into pseudoscience and dodgy marketing practices.",3.5
"I have heard of this through the Mind Valley Academy. I think it is all about maximising your well being - diet, exercise etc. by rapidly experimenting with diet, exercise to work out what works for you. Kind of like doing design thinking and prototyping on your ""wellbeing"". The idea is that you are holistic and unique an only through self discovery you can find out what works for you. 
 
 I think this might also include bullet coffee and other solutions and products that can become rituals and replace ""crash and burn"" solutions for low energy levels or the times you need to be productive. 
 
 I do, however, think the word biohacking is being misused. I see a few articles/Facebook ads about this every work. Is the word ""biohacking"" regulated? Can anyone use it?",3.5
"From my point of view, biohacking is a way of modifying our body to explore our system, to create new functions or to enhance the characteristics that we already have.",2
"Enhancing your body to work beyond it's natural capabilities e.g. hearing aid for ulta sonic hearing, implants to store memories, glasses to improve already perfect vision.",2.5
I am not too familiar but I think it is similar to me using test boosters to trick my body into naturally reacting the way I want,2
"I hadn't heard of it until now, just looked it up. Honestly I'm often dubious about this sort of thing. I like to listen to what my body needs and I try to be good to it, but I also like to indulge and sometimes be lazy, because it makes my mind happy! I do believe that a healthy diet and good amount of exercise can only help with personal wellbeing and puts you in a good position to be the best that you can. But as someone who has never even dieted, I'm not sure it would suit me at all...I'm not too keen on feeling restricted.",2.5
"I would miss everything about him because he__s nearly sixteen so we__ve spent a lot of time together! 
 
 Things I would miss the most include knowing that he__ll be pleased to see me when I get home- although he may pretend to be annoyed that I left, at first. Also him sitting on my lap in the evenings keeping me company while I__m looking at a screen and his loud purr! 
 
 His company is important to me because he was there when I was ill and it feels like he understands me. It feels like we look out for each other.",2.5
I have two cats- they each have a different personality. If one or both disappeared I would first of all be absolutely devastated. I would miss the greeting when I walk into a room- especially when I have been doing something else and they weren__t involved. I would also miss the quiet time cuddles- they know when it is the right time to settle down with me and have a moment of connection.,2.5
"I would miss my morning cat stroke. I wake up, go downstairs, put the kettle on and stroke the cat and give her a treat. Then I make coffee. 
 
 The feeling of stroking fur and the sound of purring is so comforting and so soothing. It is so nice to have something that needs me and wants me, has personality, and shows appreciation. 
 
 It would be a gap or gulf missing.",2.5
"I would miss him snuggling with me. Every night, as I plop down on the sofa around 9:30pm after I have put the kids to sleep, our cat Moko comes out from wherever he's been hiding and jumps up onto the sofa to sit right near me. I imagine him saying, ""finally those annoying little humans are gone. (big eye roll)"" I love how he pretends like he doesn't want anything to do with humans for most of the day, but then comes up to snuggle at the end. I also find it hilarious that he never directly asks for snuggles, he's not the type of cat that purrs or nudges you for a scratch or a pat. He just sits 6 inches or so from me, but we have an unspoken understanding that that means he wants some attention. So I guess I""m saying I will miss this relationship we have-- an unspoken understanding of each other.",3.5
"Cats are amazing because they__re independent so you don__t need to worry about them all the time (in contrast to a dog for example) However once a cat decides it likes you it will be super affectionate, although this will likely be on the cat__s terms! They__re also fun to play with and really cute. 
 
 There are so many cats which need homes so if you visit a rescue centre you__ll definitely know when you meet the right cat- cats choose their humans!",2
"Being a cat parent is a story of two halves. Cats have a beautiful independence- which means they can sort themselves out a lot of the time. So if I am busy, I don__t need to worry or slow down. The other side of them is attentive and loving- on their terms- they will make you feel like the most important person in the world (especially when they want food)! They have great witty personalities and you can tell they are pretty bright, in fact I think they could take over the world if they only had opposable thumbs!",2
"A cat is a pet for people who are independent but want fluffy love. 
 
 Sometimes it is great to watch a movie alone. Sometimes you want someone there to share that experience and not say, ___oooh, I know where I have seen that person before__, or make loud popcorn-eating noise. Cats will be there. They make a soothing noise and warm your feet with their fluff. 
 
 Sometimes you want a serious conversation. Other times you want to talk ""at"" someone and say really silly things. Cats allow you to do that. They don__t say ___ Oh Kate, you are being silly__. They just are there. 
 
 Sometimes you want someone to need you but not constantly demand from you. You want that connection, but also have space. This is where a cat comes in. They give love, they need foot. But, they are not always there. 
 
 Cats allow you to connect with others. Fellow cat owners can talk for hours about what their cats do and don__t do. Why do they do this etc?
 
 A cat is the ""human friend"" you wish you had. Fluffy, cute, and hours of fun. But, they give you space. 
 
 I am never bored with my cat. I know my neighbours because of my cat. It is a conversation starter because everyone has seen Jessica in our garden. 
 
 I am not good with small talk. Jessica helps. Cats are the ultimate ice breaker. 
 
 People don't judge you if your cat is naughty, they do judge you if your children are naughty.",3
"Let's start with the most practical-- You can leave them at home if you're going on vacation for a few days, unlike a dog who can't tolerate being home alone for even a day. And the MOST obvious advantage cats have over dogs--they know how to use their own bathroom indoors, no need for going outside in the rain or thunder multiple times a day to watch them pee or poop! And then there are clearly some emotional upsides--they are cuddly, but not needy. They want some space from you, but you also develop deep relationships with them. Dogs seem almost too easy to develop a relationship with, they're practically begging you to love them from minute one. But with cats, you have to work to earn their trust. It's a slowly built up love, and that feels real.",3.5
"My cat hasn__t been too well recently so I try to spoil him often. I bought a cooling mat for him to sleep on even though the U.K. is only hot enough for him to need it for about a week in the summer! 
 
 He likes to roll around in catnip so I also buy him his favourite brand. 
 
 I used to be more strict about where he was allowed to sleep but now he__s older he seems to have persuaded me to be more flexible. I think this counts as spoiling too. For example he sometimes comes and sleeps in the middle of my pillow. I only use one pillow so have to try to move to a corner if I want to continue to sleep!",2.5
"There is a time every day that is very special to me and the cats- I say me, it__s often the whole family. When we have done bedtime for the children- including singing personalized nursery rhymes- we say good night to the cats. The cats hear the singing and know what is coming next- they are very excited. They get ALL the attention, strokes, snuggles___and a lovely selection of cat biscuits- the treat ones, not their main food. We sometimes let them chase for them if they feel playful, and if not we just indulge them with all the strokes and love before the house becomes quiet for the night. They know when it__s coming and run to the ___usual spot__ ahead of us getting there so they can eagerly wait. It__s a lovely part of our routine.",2.5
"Jessica is a cat of routine. Our family has had three cats over the years and all of them have had very different personalities.
 
 If I do something outside the norm, she gets stressed out. She does not go far or venture outside of the garden and is petrified of the neighbours' cats. 
 
 So, her treat is a long stick cat treat that she gets every morning, usually salmon. If she does not get it, she just sits in the hallway waiting for it with big saucer eyes. 
 
 This is all super routine. As soon as she hears the rip noise, she comes out of hiding. I give her a stroke and she eats it. But, she needs to be left alone to eat it and in quiet. She is super sensitive to noise. 
 
 Now, my cat associates people coming into the house with shopping bags with treats. She knows that there might be snacks in there. So, she does the ___big eye__ I want a treat look. 
 
 Sometimes we use these treats as a distraction when she needs to get dosed for flees. 
 
 At Christmas, she does get a treat stocking. But, Jessica is a cat that likes the same treats, bland food, and routine so there is nothing really special to tell you about this process.",4
"Our cat Moko has always loved staring out the window. He was a street cat for a little while, so I imagine he misses exploring the outdoors, and we don't have a yard as we live in an apartment building. So I found out about these cat beds that you can attach onto windows, kind of like a hammock but stuck on the window with huge suction cups. My husband thought they were ugly and wanted me to return them. I basically snarled at him and told him that Moko can decide if he likes it or not. It was a bit of a hassle to stick them onto the window, but I just kept thinking to myself ""he doesn't ever get to leave the house! he deserves at least this much"" and kept at it. As soon as we put him in the bed he LOVED it and spends most of the day inside of it. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy every time I see him jumping into the bed.",3
"The quality of cat food available in most supermarkets frustrates me but the thing which frustrates me more is the lack of sustainability around mainstream cat products. There are more eco/ethical cat products available but you usually have to search for them and they can be more expensive. 
 
 For example, too much cat food is sold in pouches. They can be recycled but this has to be done at a specialist collection point so most people won__t bother to do this.
 
 Another example is that cat litter can be made from material which isn__t biodegradable (but will be promoted and sold on it__s clumping or odour control properties). A lot of people won__t know how bad the environmental impact is.",2
"Hmmmm___.what frustrates me the most. One thing is not knowing what is the healthiest thing to feed them. We try to research this, but it__s not always clear. As a house of vegetarians, we know that our cats are obligate carnivores so we need to feed them meat___but we sometimes wonder if there is a plant based way for them to thrive too. 
 As we are all friends here- I also get frustrated when they get poop mess on their fur- it__s rare, but my- they don__t want you to sort it out. Eeek.",3
"I think that the world offers more to dog owners - dog parks, bring your dog to work, etc. 
 
 What about cat owners being allowed to work from home?
 
 Jessica will be very stressed out if everyone started to go out more and if anyone was away for 8 hours. 
 She gets stressed if she sees suitcases because she knows it means that she will be left alone (not truly alone, we have someone who comes in twice a day to feed her and pet her). 
 
 I think people underestimate how stressed cats can get. I wish there were more products out there at a lower price point for stressed-out cats. 
 
 What if vets could advise on reducing stress and more holistically for cats as well as general health and nutrition?
 
 We are trying to reduce stress for Jessica, but some expert advice would help. 
 
 She is a cat. I don__t want to humanise her. I just want some quick tips and tricks to calm her down.",3
"Cat litter for sure. The way it gets everywhere, the way the litter box gets dirty, the smell of cat litter (weird chemical smell), the way you find tiny grains of the litter all around your house.",3
"The latest group I joined online was the Expats in Stockholm group on Facebook. I have found joining Expats in ___Insert City Name__ type groups to be incredible resources. 
 
 I joined this community because similar groups on Facebook really helped me when I was living in Paris. To this day, I am still a member of a bunch of them for Paris (like American Expats in Paris, Auto-Entrepreneurs in Paris, Women in Paris, etc.) and have joined a few similar groups for Stockholm. These communities are shockingly helpful! You can ask people about any administrative issue you are having, finding apartments, finding a specific product somewhere, and so much more. There is a social element to some of them as they do have meet-ups, but with covid, I think those are much less frequent. Sometimes people post about wanting to meet new people and do things like go get coffee to help make new friends in a new place.
 
 I felt it was especially necessary to try and get in one of these communities here in Sweden because I have very few connections in Stockholm and being an expat anywhere is complicated enough, so it is nice to have a support group or people in a similar situation. This particular group has about 7.9K members and I do think that it having a lot of members was something that attracted me to it __¡° it made it seem more trustworthy and like I really would be a part of a good sized network. 
 
 So far, I have used this group for asking a range of questions from ___how do I get a covid vaccine in Sweden without a person number (social security here)?__ or ___where do I find a certain type of shampoo?_____no question is too big or small for this kind of group! I__ve asked for recommendations for things like nice cafes and reputable modeling agencies, and I__ve even booked a photoshoot with a local photographer who had a project that needed a hand model in this Facebook group.",3
"Last year, I joined RYSE: a Facebook Groups-based community made up of AAPI young professionals across the country. The group and community focus on navigating life and career as AAPI young individuals, but also touch on areas of identity, culture and the larger society. 
 
 I first came across this group at the height of the pandemic. I was having a really tough time coping with not just the changes that the pandemic brought about, but also the waves of anti-Asian hate and violence that I was seeing across the country. Being isolated at home meant that I couldn't really depend on the community I had built around me geographically- instead, we had to shift to virtual forms of communicating and digital platforms to engage. I remember feeling really alone in my AAPI identity and having no idea how I could connect with other young people who were feeling the same way. Despite my partner being South Asian, I had very few AAPI friends who could empathize with my experiences and who could understand on an intimate identity-deep level. Local mutual aid groups were starting to spring up and pop up on my Facebook feed, and I remember wondering if there were active groups out there that were made up of AAPI people like myself. Prior to the pandemic, I rarely used Facebook as a social networking tool in general, let alone as a platform to find community. 
 
 When I did a quick search of ""AAPI"" groups, RYSE was one of the first things that came up. I remember clicking on it and being blown away that it was 60K members strong- I remember wondering whether that was a benefit or a detriment to building a safe space. I wanted to be able to connect with other young people on a deeper level. I read the description for RYSE and decided to join after reading that rules and regulations were put in place to ensure it was a safe space for all. For the first month of being a part of RYSE, I was simply a lurker and a passive member. I would read posts from others but never comment or actively participate. I would see members post to talk through topics of identity, being AAPI in the workplace, AAPI and mental health, offering resources, putting together virtual happy hours, etc. It was a few months in before the first time I became a true active participant- when an AAPI woman career coach posted to offer 1-1 individual chats for AAPI women who wanted to chat about career or simply just talk through a tough time. I remember feeling so empowered to finally participate and since commenting on her post and booking a chat with her, she has become my mentor and encouraged me to become an active member of RYSE.
 
 I also recently joined Circle of Change, which is a smaller group of BIPOC professionals working in the Social Impact or Equity & Community Engagement field. I was introduced by a friend who I connected with on LinkedIn, and this group is incredible. Although significantly smaller than my RYSE group, the members are just as incredible and passionate about the work that unites us all. With a smaller group, we have the opportunity to gather more often and do so on a monthly basis via Zoom. When not gathering via Zoom, we send emails through Google Groups on interesting articles pertaining to issues of social justice and change, stay connected on these topics through Google Groups and also share job opportunities. My friend really convinced me to join when he told me that Circle of Change members keep each other encouraged and dedicated to our larger goals of facilitating space. That was what attracted me most to this community- it is made up of people who don't just share similar backgrounds and identities but also work to keep each other encouraged in a common goal.",3
"One of the last communities I joined was an illustration community based in Spain. This community focused on scientific illustration and most of its members come from different locations (not just Europe).
 As a designer and fan of drawing/sketching, I am constantly in the look for ways to learn/improve new styles, better techniques.
 This specific community was recommended to me by a friend, and after checking some of their programs and their social media, I got hooked.",2
"The first community that comes to mind is house of providence. I know that there might be several but I choose this one for the reason that I think this is where I am making a significant impact to my bigger community. So far in House of providence we were able to locate a very big amount of families/individuals(more than 300families) who lack either food, medicine, or other life necessities and help them with their needs accordingly. I think being in a community where giving and helping others is my primary motivation of choosing House of providence.",2.5
"It was this time of my life where I felt I wanted to do something for my community that had a greater impact than just donating whatever clothes or personal items I was not using anymore. Nevertheless, I was struggling financially and personally after my divorce so I didn__t have mental space to dedicate too much time on an NGO. I used to attend events organized for expats in Argentina (BAIN) and I ran into an email requesting volunteers to deliver backpacks to vulnerable communities. And that's how I met SACS's members, all of them amazing, smart and dedicated women working to make an impact on children of a country they were just visiting for a couple of years. I connected with their mission right away.",2
"When looking at my list of communities I suppose my favorite community I__ve been involved in would be what I called my ___Language exchange communities.__ And I think I consider this to be my favorite because this community has lead me to a lot of real friendships. I used to attend a lot of IRL language exchange events or meet ups and I use apps like HelloTalk for this as well. Many of my language exchange partners have become real life friends. I actually have a Chilean Spanish/English exchange buddy who I will meet for the first time over Christmas break. We met on HelloTalk and we have been online friends for something like four years now. I guess what I enjoy most about this is I get to really connect with and learn so much about very different people while sharing and practicing language (our common goal). I think people in these groups have a lot of patience and understanding, you also bond quickly because you naturally end up talking a lot. I also really like that it helps you learn language in a very natural way and colloquial, I love the little details in languages and learning from native speakers is the best for learning idioms, expressions, jokes. Language gives you access to a whole world and culture and it is something that I have prioritized in my life, so this community is a great support system and resource, as well as fun.",2.5
"I love my RYSE community. Even though it's a huge network of people, I feel incredibly close to it. RYSE is special to me because despite its focus on career and networking as young professionals, it has evolved to be a safe space for being to talk about culture, AAPI identity, and mental health. Prior to joining RYSE, I never though that a digital community could truly provide me a safe space. What makes RYSE so special is not just the topics and the course of conversation but also the way members of the community contribute. People post job opportunities, offers to network and provide no-cost career services, job referrals and mentorship. It's a giving community and what sets RYSE apart is that members aren't there to simply better their own lives- the contributions help everyone else in the community better their lives as well. I have posted both opportunities and requests for advice before and each time have been met with such supportive responses and from that, have made new friends across the country. I deeply treasure this community because although I don't have many AAPI friends IRL, I have a wonderful community online. And of course, this community is kept engaged and together through a group Slack channel where we can communicate and start casual conversation, virtual and IRL happy hours that happen via Zoom and across different cities in the US, and a frequent discussion topics and virtual panels + events hosted and put together by the admin team.",2
"I would say there are three communities I am actively participating, and that I enjoy following their news and activities. Since one of these three is TSN, I would talk more in deep about the other two (I can mention why I like TSN some other time;). A. One community is my swimming club. Although we are a very diverse group (nationality, professional background, age, among others) we have a passion in common: Swimming. Based on this commonality, we strive to improve our times, to make trainings more enjoyable, and at the same time to build a community oriented to have sports-related conversations (events, competitions, gear, and so on) Something this community has and others lack is perhaps the 'open-doors' attitude towards people who might feel not able to join due to not knowing how to swim. There is a coach who will guide any rookie to improve their current swimming skills, feeling comfortable enough to join everyone afterwards. B. A second community is the WFSF (World Future Studies Federation). This community is oriented to investigate, discuss, train, and learn about the studies of the future. Including members from different places around the world, with diverse backgrounds and a common interest for foresight and future studies, WFSF organize a variety of activities during the year, to share new findings on actual topics, and how these could trigger reactions in other industries and scenarios. Their digital presence (newsletter, community mailing list) is very active, and enable a healthy discussion, either to learn from the experts, to ask questions/feedback on key topics, or simply to stay up to date on future-related activities around the world.",3
House of Providence,1
"My community is definitely SACS, Send A Child to School. We are not an official NGO, but we are hard working women trying to contribute our share towards education in Argentina. In the process of fundraising, purchasing, organizing the events, packing, delivering, etc., we have created a strong bond, we help and support each other, not only in SACS related matters but we are there for each other when one of us has a personal problem, we work as a team trying to do our best with the time each of us has available. Before the pandemic I really enjoyed connecting with all of them. I don__t know if it is just out of luck, but all the people that have taken part, and are currently members of SACS, have never shown any rivalry, gossip, or the like. And this is, in my opinion, a very rare characteristic in a group entirely composed of women. From a personal perspective, I feel supported in this community. Also, I feel blessed because without them I would not be able to feel as fulfilled as I feel today since I would not be able to do the same work or make the same impact we do together (not even close).",3
"1. Meet ups __¡° these are the best, nothing beats in person events. This is the best way to meet people and really connect. I think it is more ___real-life__ scenario conversations as well so that can be more interesting than just chatting online. But it is fun to gather as group in a language caf_ or in a park, many times they might have a real event like a ___drink and draw__ night or some activity as well. 
 2. Online chatting __¡° This is nice if you have a lot of free time and are trying to practice more daily. I used to do this more than I do now but it can be quite a useful and easy way to practice language while also getting to know someone. 
 3. One-on-one calls __¡° a lot of these language apps have a video or phone calling option which is important to practice actually speaking and working pronunciation. And when you become friends with people, it feels quite normal and natural just have a phone call but in another language.",2
"1. Frequent Discussion Topics & Events: Our admin team works hard to put together virtual panels & talks that bring the community together. These are formal yet casual events where leaders from the community come together to talk about issues spanning authenticity and self-expression, to identity and culture. Hosted on Facebook Live, these events are easy to join and engage with and are a great source of conversation. I say these events are formal because they're put together by the RYSE admin team, but they're also casual at the same time because these leaders are regular members of the group who are accessible as professional connections and even as friends. 
 
 2. Virtual Happy Hours & IRL Events: RYSE frequently hosts happy hours, where members are invited to simply connect and meet. These are hosted as networking events, but it does give people the chance to connect in a safe space, with other AAPI young individuals. In addition to the virtual gatherings, RYSE partners with regional organizations that help host IRL gatherings for RYSE members across different cities in the US. They partnered with student-led organization Ladder to host a NYC soiree at the end of Summer 2021. 
 
 3. A formal mentorship program! In addition to the ability to meet and engage with coaches and mentors who are also members of the group, RYSE hosts a formal mentorship program through Facebook, where members searching for a mentor can meet those who are looking for a mentee. Facebook has a feature that allows you to browse through potential mentors, their biography and start a conversation! It's a great way to stay connected to the community at large and really meet the other members in your community.",2.5
"A: 
 1. Weekly trainings
 2. Periodical get-together activities
 3. Feedback for personal improvement
 
 B:
 1. Updates on what is happening elsewhere
 2. Promote discussions on hot topics
 3. Opportunities to get involved as participant/leader",2
"1. Helping others in a selfless way which makes you feel like you're doing something that matters.
 2. Having a sense of purpose and meaning in your life beyond materialistic things.
 3. It helped me grow on all levels: Interpersonal, Humanitarian, life skills, Creativity and other",2
I feel supported. It gives me a sense of purpose. I have lots of fun.,1.5
"I think I get frustrated by the arrogance and rudeness in online, digital communities. Digital means people can be anonymous and that can come with issues. I often feel like people are looking for a fight or using these spaces for strange agendas. Moderated groups are ideal for these reasons because nasty comments or rudeness is so unnecessary. I also feel like these digital communities can be a little spammy sometimes which is annoying especially when they are spammy but not offering anything engaging. Too many notifications or alerts stresses me out and I hate being notified about about not very relevant ___news__ or whatever its trying to get you to look at.",2.5
"Oh man. Digital communities are always tough. With all the great things come a few downsides too. Because they are not geographically or physically defined, these communities can often grow drastically in member count. This isn't necessarily a bad thing- but it can be incredibly difficult to facilitate intimate and deeper connections. Despite strength in numbers, larger digital communities can also create a sense of disconnection and distrust. It took me a few months to really work up the courage to post and participate in RYSE, and that was only after reaching out to a senior leader in the group. 
 
 A community does not have to be, but should be, a safe space. This can be particularly hard on the Internet. Even within RYSE, there have been incidences of discourse and occurrences that have presented a threat to the integrity of the group and the safe space that it is for so many. Online communities are particularly hard to regulate, despite all the efforts of a wonderful admin team and all the checks in place to prevent bad seeds. It's the Internet, after all. 
 
 Lastly, in the age of Zoom fatigue, virtual gatherings can often become really static. There are moments where I feel like the level of engagement just cannot match what community looks like in-person, and with so many working remotely, Zoom gatherings without an agenda or direction or something to capture the attention of attendees, can often feel like just another work meeting or obligation. Then there's no fun!",3
"I guess my biggest frustration is to think some of these communities will never get to be real, get to be together under the same roof in real-time.
 Nowadays, with Slack communities (for example) growing rapidly in member numbers, is most likely to happen that all these people will never get the chance to meet, or perhaps, if the community get together, due to the high number of visitors, have a hard chance to meet them all, socialize with them all.
 This without mentioning the speed how information travels on internet communities, making sometimes hard to grab key information, or stay in close contact to how a topic unfolds.",1.5
"The lack of physical cues sometimes can be frustrating, as without face expressions and body gestures there is a big risk of misunderstanding. This problem is not present with live interaction, that's why I prefer it.",1.5
"I am not part of any digital community. But I can say that during lockdown we had to connect virtually with SACS members and, although it provided us a means of communicating during times when we could not meet personally, I felt that we could not connect in the same way. We didn't have the activities we used to enjoy (and I don't mean just events or outings, even when we met for packing and sorting we would have a great time), board meetings were virtual of course, and the dynamics of virtual meetings (zoom, etc) is not the same. We did manage to stay together and to stay alive during the pandemic, donating and helping communities. But it has not been, at least for me, an experience I would enjoy repeating.",2
"My manifesto would maybe focus on behavior:
 - Contribute __¡° add to the dialogue, join the discussion, get involved! This is not the place for lurking. Hear and be heard!
 - Stay calm __¡° this is not the place to vent frustrations or take your anger out on others, we are all here for common goals, and no one is looking for a bad time. Keep it light. 
 - Connect amongst yourselves __¡° this is the key, and this is what makes groups work! Pulling people in from your own personal network, sharing with your friends, meeting new people, learning from each other. 
 - Keep this a useful space __¡° either it is fun and entertaining or its highly informational
 - No such thing as a dumb question __¡° communities are a resource for a reason!",2
"1. Make this a safe space. A community is a shared experience, and should be a safe experience as well. We only promote kindness and empathy here- bring the best of who you are to this space. Be accepting, understanding and withhold judgement. 
 
 2. Be an active participant. Even if it takes a beat, or it takes some encouragement, your community is a reflection of you and what you give to it as well. Your community can only serve you well if you contribute to it. And never be afraid to get over that initial curve and let the community know what you need in order to be there and make the space better. Remember that you matter and that your presence in your community matters as well! 
 
 3. Better your life through this community, but also help this community better others' lives. When participating, think about how you can enrich your own life through your community experiences and then try to give that back to others as well. Whether you are posting opportunities for others, life advice you want to share, or simply sharing words of encouragement, always make it a point to give back what you get!
 
 4. Bring your ideas to the table! A community is again, a culmination of the people in it and is driven by the participation and minds of the members. In this community, we bring our good ideas forward and we help build the future of what this community looks like. Always feel free to contribute your thoughts and ideas- this is a place to have conversations, whether big or small! We encourage your to share your ideas, meet other members and do what you need to do to make this space yours.",2.5
"I did try before, and it is something I would still believe in: Making small, functional groups out of large-size communities. And eventually, at some point, switch members until the point everyone has the chance to know the others.
 The manifesto would start with a line like:
 - Today you are one, tomorrow you are twenty, the day after you are everyone.
 The purpose of the community (and each individual core mission) is for each one of us to know everyone. And start growing from there.",3
"What we Believe:
 1. We believe in the power of being united in a community.
 2. We believe in leading a purposeful and joyful life is everyone's right.
 3. We believe that growth is exponential when shared in a group.
 4. We believe that everyone can lock his/her full potential when given the right tactics and guidance.
 What we do:
 1. We build stronger communities.
 2. We listen, then we act based on what people have to say.
 3. We put back into the community that we work with.
 4. We help you grow and find purpose.
 5. We help shape the world we live in.
 How we work:
 1. We believe in balance in different life sectors.
 2. We strive to be fair in all our calls.
 3. We think failure is essential, we embrace it, and we know how to build on it a stronger foundation.
 4. We love risk, as it take us forward.
 5. Ethics are at our core.
 6. Creativity and passion are our fuel.",3

"I really couldn__t live without your basic sliced cheese. I__m an avid sandwich eater, so breakfast sandwiches and lunch/dinner sandwiches would be pretty BLAH without a good ol__ slab o__ cheese. My go-to is aged sharp white cheddar.",2
"It would have to be parmigiano reggiano. It is the number 1 cheese I go through so quickly, probably needed a new chunk of it every week. It is the perfect cheese to go with everything. You can add it to pasta, salad, chicken, charcuterie, etc. It can be grated or shaved, whichever is needed for the meal.",2.5
"I'd say Extra Sharp Cheddar. I always have snack-sized cheese bars in my fridge by Cabot for snacking and using with meals. It's such a versatile flavor in that it tastes delicious across many cuisines- Mexican, Italian, French, but its flavor is pungent and remarkable enough to enjoy on its own as well.",2.5
"I couldn__t live with out pepper Jack followed closely by mozzarella. I prefer my pepper Jack in slices to put on burgers, deli sandwiches and as a grilling cheese. Mozzarella is one for all my Italian cuisine choices and also in my omelet along side feta. The brands I have been using as of the last few years has been Trader Joe__s store brand. I like the creamy taste of their cheeses and I also like that their cows aren__t treated with rSBT.",3
"string cheese: very easy to eat as a snack and I do eat this regularly. For guilty pleasures: I love a good Brie cheese. Imagine a soft, warm brie accompanied by fig marmalade and a soft warm bread",3
"The last time I ate cheese.... I remember it like it was 4 hours ago. Oh yeah, it was 4 hours ago! I had my favorite breakfast, bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel. I was unusually lazy today and picked this tastiness up from my local deli.",2
The last time I had cheese was last night for dinner (7:30pm) with my salad. I love making Greek salads and feta is the perfect cheese for this meal. I make this sale frequently for my fiance.,1.5
"It's a very chilly, raw day here in NYC. I just got back from errands and decided to forgo the salad I had for lunch in lieu of something warm and comforting. I had marinated some chicken breasts earlier this week. I decided to bake one of them with some mozzarella and put it in a toasted wrap with some tomato sauce. It instantly made me feel comforted, warm, serene and got rid of the chill in my bones. I consumed this today at 2pm EST and I did so, alone.",3
"I__m in the kitchen boiling up my lasagna noodles. The date is two weeks ago and I__m getting my Chef Boyardee on, hat and all. It__s just me cooking but my son is sous chef and he__s watching me put the lasagna together. The most important part aside from the meat sauce and the way I season it, is the cheese. I put a layer of ricotta on the first layer of the meat followed by a full layer of shredded Trader Joe__s mozzarella. The top layer is a sharp cheddar and mozzarella mix to give it that gooey overdrip and that creamy mozzarella taste on top. This was a dinner for the day so it was about 6pm when I finished but I started cooking at 4pm.",3
"Last weekend NYC - winter / cold weather at a restaurant. Dinner date with my husband so we are dressed up and enjoying delicious food with a good cocktail. I ordered a pasta with wild boar ragu and the waiter ""snowed"" the most delicious cheese on top. You can see it falling like real snow coating the whole plate. It was s delicious combination.",2.5
"ALL THE CHEESE. For sliced/shredded cheese I do store brand or Kraft. For snacking I get Babybel and Boursin. For macaroni and cheese I get Velveeta or Annie__s. This is all my usual suspects, but I will literally eat any and all cheese in any form.",2
"The cheese I am eating with the Greek salad is feta. The feta I use is Bulgarian, so it is super creamy, delicate, and has a rich flavor. The brand is from Wholefoods and comes in tuberware filled with water. It is authentic and fresh.",3
It was Mozzarella which I sliced from a block and melted in the wrap with the chicken and tomato sauce. It was from Galbani.,2.5
"Trader Joe__s shredded mozzarella, Trader Joe__s shredded sharp cheese and another pack of Trader Joe__s Mozzarella.",1.5
Parmesan cheese on top of my pasta. The waiter grater the cheese on top of my pasta falling like perfect snow. I don't know the brand... but the flavor combined with the pasta and sauce was delicious,2
"I mostly add slices to sandwiches, but sometimes tear them apart for snacking too. Shreds go on certain dishes.",2
"The feta is crumbled over the Greek salad. Since the feta is super delicate and creamy, it cannot be cut into cubes and needs to be crumbled over the salad.",2.5
I toasted it in a wrap to melt it with tomato sauce and marinated chicken.,2
"Well the shredded cheese is used on our pizza, spaghetti, lasagna and my eggs in the morning. Any pepper Jack cheese is used is sliced for my cold sandwiches, turkey burgers and/or grilled cheese.",2.5
"grated on top of the pasta, mixing it with the sauce",1.5
"Comforting, familiar, satisfying. As per my day of running errands in very chilly temperatures, this food warmed my body and soul. I feel renewed and ready to continue working.",2.5
"The three words I would use to describe this experience is special, comforting, and filled with love. This salad is something me and fiance love to have together so it has become something special that we have as a new family. Also, it is comforting and filled with love because it now reminds me of home.",3
"Comforting, familiar, satisfying. As per my day of running errands in very chilly temperatures, this food warmed my body and soul. I feel renewed and ready to continue working.",3
"Experimental, engaging and enriching. 
 
 Experimental- I try to incorporate different cheese flavors into the dishes I cook as either a secondary flavor or sometimes as the whole overall flavor depending on what I__m making and who I__m making it for. 
 
 Engaging- If I__m with someone, I like to invite them into the experience even from the point of purchasing/choosing the cheese to experiment with and preparing the dish.
 
 Enriching- I get to learn something new and add on to knowledge I have obtained from these experiences.",3.5
"delicious: combining the cheese with the sauce was necessary to bring out all the flavors to the pasta. 
 warmth: the dish filled me up with warmth and love
 happiness: great date night and great food that made me happy",2.5
"As I just said, I don__t dislike ___fake__ cheese. My best friend is super lactose intolerant, so she always makes dishes with Veggie Shreds and I don__t mind them! (Although I have to say certain brands taste and texture don__t sit well with me - cough cough Daiya.)",2
"Yes! I am open to plant-based cheese but as a cheese snob, it has to be done right.",1.5
"Yes- In this realm, leaps and bounds have been made. I do use plant-based cheese for Pizza, Lasagna, Tacos, Nachos and Enchiladas. My favorite brand is Chao by Field Roast. It melts amazingly well and when I make these dishes, people often cannot tell something is different.",3
Yes; I__ve had it at vegan restaurants and it was phenomenal and I have put it on my agenda to incorporate it into my own dishes. I would like to do more research on which ones I would like to my taste and start to utilize it in the kitchen.,2
I have never tried it and did not know it existed. I would be curious to try this and see if they fulfill the warmth and love that a normal cheese has,2

Hi! I work in experiential entertainment and marketing. I recently fell into a virtual reality rabbit hole and have been coming back up for IRL air. I like to work out creative problems while mountain biking and trail running.,3
"Quality, intuitive, creativity. 
 I always start with quality... looking at the ingredients, if it__s organic, sugar content etc. Intuitive because that__s how I approach eating. I check in with my body and see how it feels like eating for the moment and don__t follow any strict rules. There__s a sense of calm and equilibrium since I__ve been eating this way. Creativity, as I__m adventurous and like expansive experiences... I love to try new flavors, interesting combos, challenging new ideas/dishes hence I__m a total foodie and constantly trying new restaurants, products that intrigue me.",2.5
Fuel treat fun,2
"Balance - I believe that my approach to food is really all about balance. If I eat badly for lunch, I try and have more sensible dinner. I am constantly counterbalancing or trying to ""even out"" what I eat. I also think it is important to eat a bit of everything so balance for me also means not eating too much of just one food group. Variety is essential and so is not overdoing any one food group. 
 
 No restrictions - The second I feel ""limited"" or ""restricted"" I tend to rebel and want to have whatever is off limits. Thus diets and restrictive eating really do not work for me. I do a million times better with an approach that is more like ""I just want to make healthy choices today"" rather than specifically saying ""no sugar, no carbs, no blah blah."" I need to feel free and like I have options, that helps me make better choices because I can eat what I want but I do so in moderation or try to counterbalance later. Maybe I lack willpower but I am much happier controlling myself rather than restricting myself. 
 
 Common sense - I think I try and approach food in a way that is pretty normal. I try listen to my body, if I am really craving something, I indulge a little bit rather than repress that desire and end up freaking out and over eating. Moderation really keeps me satisfied because I can really have whatever I want. I just try and approach food in a way that makes sense for me. I don't overly research health and nutrition but I do care about it and think its important. So I try and eat a well rounded diet and avoid overly processed foods, common sense!",4
"Healthy, grazing, measured",2
"I__ve started cooking a shanghai-nese traditional breakfast on the regular recently. A warm bowl of sweet fermented rice, poached eggs, water, sprinkled with dried osmanthus flowers. It feels very nourishing and beautifying to my body. I love how it also connects me to my family (my mom ferments the sweet rice for me) and it makes me think of my grandma as it was her fav breakfast.
 
 Organic celery that I juice first thing in the morning. I drink it on an empty stomach and it__s helped keep my skin clear and bright, helps regulate my bowel movements (I had low thyroid issue so constipation could be an issue before), drinking a vibrant green glass of juice also psychologically makes me feel healthy and that I__m taking good care of myself.",3
"I love coconut water- it gived me energy and keeps me running when I need it. I drink it as a pick me up. It makes me feel refreshed, alive and clean, especially important when exercising and travelling. I also love caffeine- it clears the fog when I am tired and need to be alert. I drink it first thing in the morning and it makes me feel alert- especially important when travelling different timezones. My guilty please is frappucinos. I buy them as a treat when I have worked really hard and have a hectic day. They motivate me, give me something to look forward to and make me feel relaxed and treated.",2.5
"1. Coffee - This is probably not the healthiest because I always take my coffee with a bit of sugar. I buy it to have in the morning and after lunch, I think my coffee breaks are little moments that help break up my day, so I really look forward to them. Coffee makes me feel better and my body really wants it, so I have it. I do also get headaches if I don't have coffee. (This might be addiction haha... but still, it makes me happy so it is important to me.)
 
 2. Yogurt, Granola, and Berry Bowls - I have a variation of this pretty much everyday for breakfast. I love the mix of textures and it gives me enough energy to get me going in the morning. This makes me feel good because it isn't too heavy but it is filling because sometimes I add oats or chia seeds. I buy it because I feel like it is a healthy and balanced breakfast, it has a bit of protein, fruit, sugars, and carbs. 
 
 3. Veggie Pasta - This is one of my go to dinner/lunch meals. It is super easy and quick but also very tasty and I just throw in whatever vegetables I have. I mostly use onions, zucchini, and eggplant but will throw in things like mushrooms, peppers, carrots, etc. I love vegetables and I really enjoy cooking them. This meal makes me feel full but not guilty about what I have eaten. I think its a good way to get in a lot of vegetables in one meal.",2.5
"Turmeric lattes (w/coconut milk). My PT recommended Tumeric for inflamation so I started mixing it into smoothies. Then I found out some cafes were serving it as a latte (though one or two do it with espresso which I do not want). It's usually my mid to late afternoon tasty boost. Hard to tell what the turmeric is doing but I like it's earthy flavor which helps me feel grounded.

"Hmmm... I suppose it__s a consideration in the back of my mind but I don__t specifically shop for a certain quantity or consciously think to myself I need a certain portion for the day. Usually I will consume mostly seafood if I__m making food for myself and that__s my protein (sardines, tuna). And when I dine out that__s when I__ll eat meat and get my animal proteins. Plant proteins happen organically thru the nut milks I drink or let__s say when I__m eating a chia pudding.",2
"I never really think of what I eat. I trust my body to tell me what it needs. On reflection, I do crave protein on a daily basis. I tend to crave chickpeas, tofu, cheese, eggs and lentils a lot. I was vegan for a while but now reverted back to being vegetarian as my body craves eggs and protein shakes. I have eggs most days for breakfast and a protein shake every other day.",2.5
"I do not overly focus on protein but I do try to eat things like yogurt or eggs here and there because I do not tend to eat a lot of meat. I am not vegetarian but I do not like to cook meat. I definitely avoid cooking typical proteins and tend to make things with chickpeas, beans, or buy things with tofu. I do not use any protein powders or supplements and I do eat meat or fish from time to time.",2.5
"I have a very intuitive approach to protein. I can just feel when I crave it and I will usually eat nuts, tofu, chicken, eggs, fish. I don't eat red meat too often. It's just a part of my usual diet but doesn't require much thought.",2

"I went for a drive to Dungeness and saw a plant growing at the beach that looked a lot like kale. I stole one (it's a nature reserve- woops) and I am now growing the plant. My boyfriend told me it is sea kale. It is a really amazing plant. Much stronger in taste then kale, really hard to get hold of (noone sells it) and it is super healthy. It boosts your immune system, aids digestion and is packed with vitamin c.",3.5
"I saw a video on BBC called ""Can tech create a more planet friendly burger?"" and it is all about replicating meat from plants or lab grown meats from real animal cells. The lab grown meat sounds kind of gross and is at this point unaffordable so I doubt it will be on the market soon. But the idea is interesting and I think connecting how/what we eat to its impact on the planet and environment is really important. In general people are becoming more and more concerned with sustainability, but for me, at least because I work in the fashion industry, I see it most connected to consumer goods. I feel like people forget that what you eat also contributes to these issues and it is noteworthy that companies are starting to look for alternatives and ways to reduce their negative effects on the environment.",4
"It's not new but I've been reading up more about and experimenting with cacao. I guess the last ""new"" thing I saw was ""craft"" mushrooms.

At its most basic level, it is needed for survival but it is also something that can be fun to learn about, make and eat and I use it as a way to show love to friends family and colleagues.

Furthermore, I__m a firm believer in that all food should be good for either the body or the soul (or ideally both). So there is nothing wrong with a piece of cake every so often if it brings you joy!",2.5

"I am a foodie and always have been. I've been raised to appreciate a wide variety of good quality, healthy foods and never shy away from trying something new or unusual. I believe that food is an integral part to my wellbeing, if I eat poorly I feel it in my body but it also brings down my mood. I know for certain that if I have healthy, exciting foods on hand when busy or stressed then it makes me able to tackle my problems better, I would even go as far as to say I think about my next meal in order to distract myself, perhaps too much, from the tasks at hand! Having now also had my first child in November last year, having quick and easy options to keep me fuelled and nourished is even more important. I have really realised the need for healthy food choices when dealing with a baby and always being 'on call' as a mum.",3

"I LOVE food. It is so so important to me. Connecting with process and flavour and taste matters to me. Food I have made from scratch- veggies and products locally sourced places makes me feel nourished and like i'm respecting my body and the plant which makes me feel connected. They joy I feel eating my own home-baked bread is so much more than when something is shop bought. I think it means I spend a lot of time thinking about any buying food, alongside wanting to learn more processes. For me food is at the heart of community and connection. We eat together most nights, taking it in turns to cook. It is ritual and core to our living together.",3
I recently tried Off the Eaten Path rice and pea sea salt crisps. I was having a BBQ with family and wanted something a bit different than just basic crisps. Initially I was drawn to it as it came in a cardboard box not plastic bag like all the others on the shelf. And the brand name made me laugh. I bought it because they looked to be made of natural ingredients and less greasy than even the fancier crisp brands.,3

"Tonys Chocoloney has really caught my attention recently. Not only is the chocolate itself delicious, but the branding is modern, eye-catching and has such a fun attitude even though the message and ethos of the brand is impactful regarding ending slavery in the cocoa trade.

"I recently bought Little Moons Mochi balls, after the packaging really caught my eye; it was colourful, well labelled, boasted that it was V & GF and the photos of the mochi balls looked great too!

"I would just like to add that although I consider myself a 'foodie' and have no qualms about eating dairy, I am trying to reduce it in my diet for both health and environmental reasons. I have recently switched to oat milk in my cereal for instance because I love the taste more than cows milk and I also get the benefit of it encouraging milk supply for breastfeeding.",1.5
"No one in our family has any food allergies/intolerances and dairy free/gluten free products always used to seem like a really poor substitute, and I was thankful I didn__t have to have them. In the past few years I__ve been pleasantly surprised by how much things have come on and now I__ll often choose these options because they taste better. I__m excited to give anything a try, especially if it__s healthier/more sustainable",2
"I spent the last year living in an eco-community in Scotland- i was the main cook- we ate all veggies from the garden (which meant a month of parsnips in the winter haha) but it has significantly changed my relationship to food for the better- connecting me so much more and making me really think about food.I'm a bit obsessed with bread and jam making- one day I want to run a social enterprise with young people making bread and jam, maybe have a cafe with some chickens for eggs too! I've started growing my own food and heard someone say that growing your own food it the ultimate act of anarchy which i kind of loved....for me it a connecting, spiritual way to live thatI have just uncovered and am new in my journey with it and need to balance it with working 9-5, but food and cooking and baking and growing are all ultimate therapy for me.",3
"Someone who__s conscious, aware, has a rapport with their soul, kind, wise, self-loved",2
"To me, ""inside out beauty"" means taking care of one's body at the skin (""out"") level via moisture maintenance + general physical upkeep, as well as the ""inside"" via healthy eating, regular exercise, and mental health exercises. With the technology available to all at designated price points today, it's all too possible to fake a beautiful appearance on the outside through the use of surgical procedures and fillers, and I would imagine ""inside out beauty"" to mean a more holistic beauty that encompasses the realm beyond the level that people see on the outside.",3
When I hear this concept I think of the person within. How they feel about themselves and how they project themselves onto others.,1.5
"I am mindful of what I put my attention on/watch/consume/allow into my field. I__m constantly learning new wisdoms, ideas that empower and expand my consciousness and empowerment. I understand our quantum creative powers so I intentionally practice positive affirmations, visualizations in terms of embodying the feeling of radiance when I drink my morning celery juice.",2.5
"One ""inside out"" thing I picked up on in the new year is meditation and mindfulness in general. I was born and raised in a city environment, and my day to day is always rushed and varying degrees of stressful. The fast-paced environment has shaped me into a person who's always thinking and worried to some extent. I picked up physical exercise and running a few years ago, and while this has quelled my restlessness to some extent (with the added bonus of physical fitness), I did find myself more fit on the outside than inside. I recently began to meditate every day so as to be more mindful of my surroundings and not get lost in the rush of the day to day, and I think this translates on the outside when I'm not as wound up as I have been historically.",3
"The latest thing I have noticed about myself is that when my diet consists on non-nutritional foods (specifically sugar), I look, feel and act awful. I am fatigued which can be noticed from my appearance (sluggish, slow moving, bags under the eyes) I get irritable (less patience, short temper), which can be projected onto my family. My self-confidence gets run down which can lead to minor depression spurts. So, I try to make sure that I am eating consistently healthy to alleviate any of these symptoms. 
 I need to drink a lot of water, otherwise, my skin becomes dry and at times if too much sugar is in my system, acne breakouts.
 I try to exercise on a regular basis to keep up my energy levels. If I slack, I find I become more lethargic.",3.5
"As I learn more about the quantum field from Joe Dispenza, Gregg Braden, Bruce Lipton... their teaching have the same message of the power of our feelings/vibrations in creating our dream life. I__ve noticed a lightness of being and feeling less scared and more excited of the unknown/future. I__m also intentionally dialoguing with my body to be vibrantly healthy and radiant.",3
"I was inspired to adopt this recently because mindfulness and meditation has been on rise in popular media, and I was encouraged by some friends in recent months. I had always enjoyed the meditative aspects of yoga (rather than the physical aspects), and I couldn't put my finger on that until I began to meditate. There haven't been dramatic changes yet, but I do find myself recognizing anxious behaviors 50% of the time now. Being able to recognize this behavior allows me to take the necessary actions to solve for it, and this has been very helpful.",2.5
"I have been on a lifestyle change since my first child 8 years ago. It has definitely been a journey and continues. I am forever learning more things about myself, my body and how to care for it. 
 My goal was to be at my best health for my children so I could grow with them and do all the things they love with them and be able to physically keep up with them. 
 I have struggled with weight issues my whole life since I was a teenager. Now, I am at a comfortable place because I understand all the reasons how I got here in the first place. 
 Through a lot of reading and practice I think I have a much better approach at it. Mindset is my number one achievement. It has to start with loving yourself before you can love others. I feel that I am finally at this stage. 
 So, yes, I have a better perspective on what changes I've needed to make for myself and my family. I now know what foods are going to keep me healthy and not falling 'off the wagon' anymore. My weight is less that years before, still not ideal but closer.",3
"Definitely. Being mindful of what I put in my body, superfoods, quality ingredients, how I eat (intermittent fasting), all contribute to overall wellbeing. True beauty comes from a holistic approach.",2
"Definitely. I think dietary choice dictates one's day to day experience. Given that food dictates one's energy levels, regularity, and skin condition, I think dietary choice is of paramount importance as far as inside out beauty is concerned. While good genes can go very far in carrying one's physical appearance, there are foods that can cause the body physical discomfort in many ways, and this is very apparent most of the time.",3
"I think I have already touched on this in the above questions. (I would be repeating myself)
 It most definitely does. All the reasons I noted above. I have now become very aware of how food and lack of exercise can affect my 'inside out beauty"" now that I have made the lifestyle changes.",2.5
I__m currently signed up to Ben Greenfield__s Longevity Effect quest on Mindvalley. It__s all about beauty and longevity and biohacking the body to its optimal levels. He biohacked his biological age down to 20 from his chronological age of 36 and I__m looking forward to implementing the course and see what exciting results I get!,3
"A few years ago, I read an article about how dietary supplements (e.g. vitamins) can be made from seemingly benign but still unregulated or health benefit-unproven products that can cause more damage than good. I think it's important to note things like this because health/wellness is a bigger priority than ever before. With that and the idea that everybody is so eager to ""optimize"" these days, it's all too easy to feel the need to consume supplements without doing the research and mindfully adding it to one's daily regimen.",2.5
"Oh my goodness, so many things!
 
 Superfoods-I had to understand how natural foods were going to help in promoting a healthier lifestyle. My favourites so far - peppermint, hemp hearts and nutritional yeast
 Mindfullness/Meditation - currently practicing through the app of HeadSpace - seeking enlightenment!
 Detox - Wanted an understanding of the safest ways to rid of toxins in the body 
 Essential Oils - ongoing education to reap thesed benefits. I am constantly searching for the best home remedies.",3
"I've got a pair of B&O's that I'm super proud of. The design is slick and not at all overbearing. The sounds quality is high, maybe a bit to soft for my preference but worth it for its ability to make most styles of music render great. Plus, the simplicity of the design fits my preferences. If I had to add another brand in there, it would probably be AiAiAi. The modular nature of the design and the quality of the bass is hard to resist.",2.5
"I'm a fan of over ear headphones because the sound is the most important thing for me. So I would normally choose Sennheiser because of the sound quality. But a big part of headphones being cool is the way they look, and for that other brands like Sony and Beats are doing it better. The WH-H800 h.ear on 2 Mini Wireless Headphones in pale gold look beautiful! And I think wireless is pretty important now.",2.5
"Cool is a matter of context. Apple's AirPods have mainstream credibility and spawned a new category of headphones. AiAiAi have credibility on design and collaborations. Bose noise cancelling headphones are THE travel headphones and popular amongst creatives in offices to screen themselves off. For me personally I like Sennheiser HD-25 II - they are a design classic in the mould of Dieter Rams school of honest design, environmentally friendly due to their serviceability, tough, amazing sound and amazing list of owners. You can customise their look via lots of kits on eBay and other places",3
"The modular AIAIAI ones really catch my eye due to the interchangable system & the cool collaborations they have done with brands such as BrainDead, Ed Banger etc. Being able to put your twist on a pair of headphones in a tasteful way (not bright & tacky) is super cool & not really been done.
 
 I also love the super tech, high performance brands but whether they are cool or not.. the jury is out. (Bose, B+O etc) I am really into sound quality within my price range so always check the likes of WHAT HI-FI to get the best sound for my money while maintaining some level of cool.",3
The Bose noise cancelling headphones. Super pure sound and definitely no other sounds coming through as they are designed for the recording studio. I don__t care much about the optic. More about purity of sound.,2.5
"I can't say I have a brand in mind. Generally I am not a fan of 'eye catching' designs. The simpler the better, with a focus on the tech side. I almost feel as the headphones are an extension of the body, a seamlessly integrated design.",3
"Apples iPhone headphones are awful! They sound tinny and they never fit well in my ears. They don't look terrible, but what's the point if the quality is bad?!",2
"For me it would be the likes of House of Marley, Beats and V-Moda who built a brand on hype rather than product performance. It is also disappointing to see the quality drop in formerly great brands like AKG and Denon. The plastics on the headphones feel cheap and have an unpleasant new plastic smell which you didn't have before. The sound is mediocre at best, using standard designs from their China manufacturing partners rather their own engineering.",2.5
"Even after watching 'The Defiant Ones' Netflix documentary which in part talks to the Apple take over of Beats, how they dreamt up the brand & have 'pushed personal sound' forward.. but for me, they remain tacky, plastic, brand high-jacked (by fakes) over-priced and just all round 'know don't know all that much about music' headphones. All this without even ever trying a pair on, or indeed playing music through them. It's just perception. Celebrity endorsement rarely works for building brand equity, just sales to followers.
 
 Bose, B+O & a few others aren't massively cool but at least they have a certain prestige to them and know what they're talking about. Reputable brands that because they're expensive, they must be good... surely?! Right?
 
 Let's not even taaaaalk about iPhone headphones.",3
Beats by dr.dre. In my opinion they are being hyped but the sound for the price isn__t that good. The bass levels are too high in my opinion. So classical music for example sounds bad. EDM or HipHop sounds great though. Also I__m not the biggest fan of the design. For the price they aren__t worth it. You can get other brands for the same price and way better sound quality.,2.5
I own a pair of B&O H6 in Black and a pair of bass heavy Betron B750 in earphones.,1.5
I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum headphones and a pair of Sennheiser HD205's,1.5
"Sennheiser HD-25 II headphones that are my go to pair out of the home. Bose QC-25s (with after-market ear pads and cabling to improve their performance), Seinnheiser HD-250 Linear II for home use. Sony MDR-EX800ST for short haul travel / business trips.",2.5
I have a pair of RHA S500 in ear headphones which for what I use them for (mainly iPhone spotify) do the trick. I also have a pair of Sony MDR EX450 in ear headphones that serve me for more active things like snowboarding / exercise. They sit slightly deeper in my ear and never fall out - despite them not being meant for exercise. I have a pair of V-Moda V-MODA Crossfade M-100 over ear headphones which I use when I know i'm not going to move at all & currently for the odd mess about bedroom DJing.,3
For on the go I have my apple standard headphones. For travelling I have Bose noise cancelling headphones,1.5
"The more I think about it, the more I realise how diverse my use of headphones is. The obvious ones, listening to music and podcasts, phone calls with parents - the rest of the world now just texts. Apart from that, I sometimes use them to deflect an engagement in conversations, almost like ear plugs. I recently discovered I enjoy just having them on with no music, like on an airplane when reading a book, it muffles the surrounding sounds just enough.",3
I use the Momentum ones for everyday listening out and about. The HD 205's are what I have for recording.,1.5
"I use HD-25s the bulk of the time, as they are ideal to use with my tricked out iPod Classic (it has an SSD with 256GB of memory) - they're great driven from a low power device. I use the HD-250 Linear II with my hifi and laptop at home - bigger sound space and better to wear for long periods. I use the Bose on long haul flights and working in noisy offices - noise cancelling. I use the Sony headphones for short haul flights and weekend trips away as they pack an amazing sound for their size",2.5
"I would take my RHA's to work / listen to podcasts, Spotify and any youtube video etc. They're good clarity and extremely light and packable. These are my daily babies! I keep my Sony ones in my running jacket and use them solely for exercise.. I don't wish to get my RHAs sweaty, wet & horrible. My V-Moda are good for a higher quality of sound. For instance, i might build a playlist on the go using my RHAs. But will sit in my room and listen to it with my V-Moda to enjoy it more. They pick up sounds & levels you can't expect an in ear to.",2.5
"So apple in ear headphones (not air pods) for day to day when I go to work/uni/etc. And when I go on a plane,train, travelling in general I use my Bose noise cancelling headphones. So that even if there__s a crying baby on the plane I won__t hear it.",1.5
I mostly use both with either an Iphone SE or a Mac Pro,1.5
My Momentum's mostly get plugged into my iPhone SE and sometimes my iPad 4. My HD 205's get used with my MacBook pro along with my M-audio Fastrack and Logic. Sometimes I also plug them into my Yamaha keyboard.,2.5
Old Denon PMA 707 amplifier (. Allen & Heath mixer. iPod Classic with a 256GB SSD (after market modification). MacBook Pro,2.5
"Mainly all to my iPhone. I may put them in my Macbook from time to watch Netflix or a video podcast.. but on the whole, my phone.",1.5
My iPhone or my MacBook. I prefer wire over Bluetooth to be honest as I don__t like the hustle of having to charge them. Or them running out and interrupting my constant listening to music.,1.5
"I always have the Betron earphone with me, either listening to music while moving from point A to point B or noise canceling my surroundings to be more productive and focused on a particular task. They definitely are my traveling tech. As for the B&O headphones, the are a solid companion at home for music, podcasts, white noise and guided meditation. Or, when I go exploring the city taking photos; drifting around with music just loud enough to still hear the sounds and people around, that's when the B&O headphones work best for me.",3
"My Momentum's are a bit smaller and easier to carry around, they also have a nicer look, so I take them out with me. I tend to keep my HD 205's plugged in, set up and ready to go for when I'm recording.",2
"I have Sennheiser HD-250 Linear II because I love their sound which is ideal in a small house like mine where you don't have the luxury of proper speaker staging (I also don't have the the time to do this). I use Sennheiser HD-25 II for my iPod and on the go. They are more compact than the 250s, and more robust, if anything breaks you can buy the parts and fix them really easily. They also require less power to drive them at a reasonable volume so ideal for my iPod and laptop. I use Bose QC-25 for when flying long haul to take out the noise and in open plan offices for the same thing. I don't need wireless in these circumstances and like being able to use a single AAA cell at a pinch so haven't upgraded to the 35s. If I am doing a session at the gym, a short haul trip or a weekend away, the bulk of the QC-25 or HD-25 is a waste so I use the Sony MDR-EX800ST - amazing sound for the size.",3
"I like to have a 3 sets of headphones for the following reasons;
 > Portability
 > Sound quality
 > Remain in ear during exercise",1.5
As already touched upon. I can__t wear noise cancelling when I__m going to work/etc. As I need to hear a car coming up etc. So for that I have the basic apple in ear headphones.,2
"I am wearing them as I type. Background music to keep the writing flow going. It acts like a button on/off, I plug them into my laptop and then in my ears and I am going on a journey. Or, in this particular moment, ready to take on a new task. In a way, it help me create a more well defined environment for myself, a bubble within a bubble that is my focus place.",3
I was listening to some songs on Spotify on the train on my way to a gig to refresh myself on the melodies and words. I went from answering emails and messages to just listening and reading the words at the same time and watching out of the train window. It was a very calm moment. I often find putting headphones on and listening to music while I'm out and about in London has the tendency to slow everything down. It also makes me look around more and take things in.,3
"https://youtu.be/KvK1LDRo4_A?t=64
 
 It was preparing to get some work done. I needed peace and my own space to think, the headphones and music provided that space. I had my headphones connected to my headphones and started mapping out ideas on post-it notes and a blank wall... This Gary Oldman clip kind of gets it - the peace before the mind focuses on the issue at hand. I hasten to add no drugs apart from caffeine were involved.",3
"In my day to day life I am quite a private person when I want to be - for me, headphones can be an escape from the hustle bustle and create a world (whether playing music or not) of peace & quiet. I sometimes have my ear phones in on the tube - no song playing.. just for some time to myself. City life demands a lot on the senses, headphones can create an environment for reflection, thought and also wholly immerse you in the music of your choosing.
 
 Alot of the time my music is a sort of soundtrack between different happenings in my day - one for the way to work my be something i know am familiar with while something on the way home could be more of a discovery.. a playlist or artist i haven';t ever experienced before.",2.5
"Let__s say it__s a warm welcome back. Music is like an old friend whose always around. And a way to get out of the hectic day to day. And always a way to relax, no matter where. Music and headphones are an opportunity for connecting with ones emotions, no matter if melancholic or ready for the party hyped up.",2.5
"Have you ever laid in an open meadow, on the grass and just looked up at a bright blue sky, filled with puffy whispy white clouds? At some point, as you keep looking at that sky, you start to feel endless, expansive, and like it goes on forever and ever (which it does). The only thing that holds you there is well, the earth underneath you. That's what the feeling of standing at the edge of the ocean brings. Looking far beyond you and feeling like it lasts forever. Even if you're not by the ocean (which is the biggest body of water), being in a lake or a river can give you the feeling of happily getting lost- with your own body really holding you in place. 
 
 What's interesting about water is that all the systems of nature work together to influence rivers, lakes, oceans, and even streams. If it's a particularly windy day, you'll see the tides of the ocean swell and crash onto the shore. The sound is as loud as thunder, but on a calm day with the sun in full force and the winds calm and quiet, the ocean waves can almost sound soft, like occasional rainfall and be warm to emerge in. 
 
 Water is both this static and dynamic- if you're standing in a stream on a particularly quiet day, where the other forces of nature are taking that restful break, you'll feel almost frozen in time. Here, the water is static and still. But maybe you're kayaking along a lake on a particularly loud day where the forces of nature just can't be tamed- you really feel the dynamic movement of the water around you. Maybe it's pulling you along fully on its own or maybe you feel the direction it's moving in- either ways, this is when water is at its most dynamic.",3.5
"Natural water was as beautiful as it was vital. It provided something spectacular for every sense. Sight, sound, touch, smell, and even taste. 
 
 The sight of a body of water was incomparable. It flowed, it glistened, and it appeared endless. It could be a cold dark blue or a warm aqua. No matter the water, it always took my breath away.
 
 The sound of water is something so soothing you can almost remember being in the womb. It cradles you and it calms you. You know that ""ocean wave"" app on your phone? That was real. The constant ebb and flow of the ocean, the trickle of a babbling brook. Imagine sitting aside that sparkling body of water and hearing the sounds it effortlessly creates.
 
 The feeling of water is just like your bath tub, but bigger than life. Your hand touching a cold mountain stream instantly revitalizing your soul. Your body floating in a lake or ocean, similar to the float tanks you have now, although full of life.
 
 The smell of fresh water or salt water is tantalizing. You can smell it from a distance. We would drive to the beach and roll down the windows when you got close to the coast. A cool breeze with a hint of salt and ocean life. 
 
 The taste lingers on your lips. Imagine your salt water pool but one that stretches forever and it belongs to the world.",3
"My idea for the time capsule is inspired by experiences I've had at aquariums or natural history museums in their ""touch tanks."" I would want to create a tactile, immersive, and literally hands-on experience for people to help them not only understand, but also feel what different bodies of water were like. I think your imagination can go deeper if you can not only see something but also touch it, smell it, and feel pieces of the whole experience. This is like giving pieces of the puzzle for these people to put together mentally to help them understand the full picture of what these waters might be like. I would want there to be these elaborate touch tanks that are rigged with audio, wind, heat but I also think the main take away from these waters is the feeling and sensation of swimming. 
 
 It would be amazing to have an antigravity experience to simulate the weightlessness of swimming but in combination with a VR head set that was like looking through the eyes of someone swimming. Then after doing the swimming experience, people could go to the various touch tanks and try to discover what makes them all so different from each other. 
 
 
 Ocean ___touch tank__: 
 1 The viewer would need to be standing on surface of very tiny rocks, seashells, and sand to stand on, the sand would be compact and hard so feel like just where the water meets the shore.
 2 A recording of waves would be played for the audio experience, but the repetitive crashing waves sound is soothing and not too harsh, like it would be on a calm day at the beach.
 3 A salty smelling, foam spray and a fan that would be automated to simulate the sensation and smell of a wave crashing against the shore and what it feels like to be close to the water.
 4 A graze of kelp / seaweed that would brush against their leg to imitate that almost horrific feeling of something slimy and leafy touching you while swimming in the water.
 5 A heat lamp on the back of the neck to simulate the sun 
 6 The viewer__s hands would reach into a humid case and be able to see and feel various textures and consistencies of plants, animals, and objects that would help build a mental picture of what all lived in the ocean like a spikey starfish, the squishy tops of a jellyfish, the bumpy shell of a crab, the roughness of a piece of coral, the smoothness of a piece of seaweed, etc___ I feel like the diversity of things living in the ocean is important to understand via touch because the sensations are so specific. 
 
 River ___touch tank__
 1 A sloped surface of smooth, oval shaped rocks, with slimy moss or algae to try and balance / stand on.
 2 A recording of some rapids, a waterfall, and then a slower more tranquil piece of water sounds would play to help the viewer understand the continued motion and states of change in a river. This would highlight the different speeds and ___emotions__ that a river can have.
 3 The viewer could ideally be in some sort of simulator that would make the feeling of flowing down a river, and dipping up and down during rapids, and feel the pressure of water falling from a waterfall. I think this could be simulated somehow with air pressure maybe. 
 4 The rocks to me are what I think most about when I think of rivers I__ve been in. Sometimes they are quite small and slimy, and I think feeling different rocks would be important here.",4
"The thought of a world without water bodies makes me sad. Being by the ocean is my ultimate happy place. I can't help myself from smiling when I see the sunshine dance on the waves or a lake reflect the sky perfectly. As an artist and designer, lakes, beaches, oceans, ocean life is a stream of unlimited inspiration. Every time you visit any of these places, there is something new and interesting to discover and investigate. I also feel that locations by the water are healing to the soul. You could spend endless hours watching the waves, listening to the seagulls, feeling the warm sand on your feet, breathing in fresh and clean air. You remember to breathe deep and let go of all your worries. The other feeling that I always experience when I am in the water is freedom. I love to just float on the water, I love the buoyancy. It reminds me that I can lighten my burdens anytime I choose and just let nature take over! Oceans, lakes, rivers, canals to me are pure magic! It is a thin veil between the seen (above the surface) and the unseen (underwater). It is a portal, an entryway and peek into who we really are as humans as so much of our bodies are made of water and I believe this is the reason why we feel so connected to water. Being by the water stimulates EVERY one of our senses and this experience is the feeling of really being ALIVE!",2.5
"I'd like to include some items in the time capsules, so people in the future can understand the magnitud of the influence that water has in our lives. First I'd wish for people in the future to listen to the subtle but permanent presence of the ocean in a Queen Conch, to taste its salt and try to imagine how every wave must feel against our body when we ride it or crush it. I also wish for them to see its power, its anger and also its gentle flow. And somehow, try to connect all the water bodies and species in the way they are linked and dependant. Explain how it is the same water that we dive into, what hits us in the face in an extreme hot summer day, what makes us shrivel with a cup of coffee while we watch the rain fall, or with a cold beer when we take shelter from the rain at the beach.",1.5
"I really wish I had more time to connect with nature (yes, although we're focusing in on aspects of nature in this project, I truly mean this sentiment). I live in the heart of NYC, which means the most nature I can immediately get is a 30 minute subway ride away in Central Park. And while Central Park is great, I really wish I could in those 30 minutes just as easily access hiking trails with natural hidden waterfalls, opening up to a lake or a river. I am a born and raised New Yorker, so city-living is in my blood but I often daydream of being able to just take a day and hike, explore parks, and be present in those quieter, stiller and more authentic moments. 
 
 I travel a lot every year so I can access some of what I was talking about above. This year, I visited Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Laguna Beach, California, where I had the opportunity to really connect with nature. On each of these trips, I was able to relax and enjoy my environment in a way that I just can't access in my day-to-day urban jungle life. Not only did every part of me feel physically more present, capable and healthy when I was out in nature (I spent a week in Hawaii with nearly a hike each day)- I also felt at my best inwardly. It was a combination of my body able to participate in hiking, enjoying parks and waterfalls, swimming at the beach, etc but also being in a space without the presence of pollution, throngs of people and general city living. I miss this feeling. This is when I am at my best. 
 
 I've tried to make it a goal of mine to go to Upstate NY about twice a month and go hiking, but given how far it is and how much of my life is tangled up between work, school and just commuting, I haven't been able to really be present with nature in the way I want to.",2.5
"If I could change one thing, it would be my overall energy level and motivation. Perhaps it's just aging, or the constant changing world and pressures, but I sadly feel less energy and motivation as the years go by. I know this is somewhat vague and not as simply attainable, but I would love to wake up with more zest for life. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy and fairly successful, but I'm lacking some oomph lately. Maybe if I woke up and looked out my window and saw a glistening body of water...",2
"Currently, I really miss the feeling of freedom and like I can easily travel wherever I please. Traveling and going on adventures is what makes me happiest, and I feel that I__m not able to do this to the degree that I would like to / used to. I moved to Europe from the US because I liked the idea of easily hoping from one country to the next, being spontaneous and booking something just because I found a good deal or I have been dying to go there. I am curious and I like changing things up. I want to see what is out there! I feel like I had just started visiting a lot of the places on my bucket list, I had gained a lot of confidence in my trip planning skills, and stress management skills when it came to bigger trips. I dream of these experiences that are so quotidian for someone else but feel completely brand new to me. I feel a bit more restricted now with the current state of things (of course we all do and there are bigger issues at hand) but I have been trying my best to do what I can and explore more locally! I think the most important thing that this gives me is something to look forward to and something to throw myself into (either the planning or research part as well as the actual trip!)",2
"The one thing that I would like to work on in my life is letting go of self doubt. I have been working on my habits and have become more reflective ever since the pandemic. It has given me the realisation that our time here is limited and though learning and growth is essential, you cannot hold on the the idea of perfectionism before you move to action. Sometimes messy action is better than overthinking and remaining stuck. Imposter syndrome is real even for folks who have achieved great accomplishments in their careers. Every time you begin something new, it requires courage and a beginner's mindset. My dream (which I am currently working on) is to provide creative wellness solutions for mental health. I feel that art has been my support system and self regulation tool all my life and I would like to share its benefits with others. I believe that if each of us takes responsibility for our own mental, emotional and physical wellness we can make this world a beautiful place to live in and thrive collectively.",2.5
"I wish I had more time and energy to do the things I love. I recently moved from Mexico City into the country to a city where I study the university (Puebla), and this simple change of setting really improved the feeling of lockdown that I had for the last 16 months. I still have the same free time as before, but since I have more open space physically and visually, I feel like I am less ""trapped"" (less urbanization). I am the kind of person that can spend 4 hours concentrating in an activity, so I wish I could do more activities not related to day work or side hustles.",1.5
"Prabal Gurung. Not only is the company founded by an Asian American man, but as the face of the company, Prabal stands up for his communities and the causes he cares about. He has also designed collections with messaging for immigration rights, and created fashion shows where the models were deliberately diverse and reflective of people of color. As we grow to be a more and more accepting, inclusive and diverse country, I hope to see other brands take notes from brands like Prabal Gurung. 
 
 Here's an example to expand on this idea: Let's be honest- there are tons of brands in the makeup space. There are actually just too many to count and keep up with- and the majority of them can deliver on the same quality and results. So consumers are then faced with the question of how we choose which ones to show up for and support. More and more Americans (particularly looking at the millennial and Gen-Z population), are looking to brands that align with their values and identity. This means that a consumer like myself is going to choose Fenty Beauty over a brand like YSL or Tarte, because Fenty Beauty delivers on being a brand that strives to do good. Not only is their collection of colors more extensive and representative of the diversity of women who are actually using their products- their marketing, advertising and messaging is also created with the same principles. For example, their latest campaign featured single black mothers of New Orleans, who were all body diverse and had their own incredible stories to tell. Fenty Beauty not only does good, but approaches messaging, advertising and brand authenticity in a way that is innovative and unique. Fenty does not need to follow the cookie cutter model of showing up for a community or being diverse. 
 
 As an Equity & Community Engagement professional, I am particularly attentive to knowing which brands are truly creating equitable messaging and engaging storytelling moments, but even moreso, I belong to a generation of individuals (Gen-Z) who are more ethnically diverse and well-educated than any other generation previous. This is according to research done by Pew Research Center, and as Gen-Z becomes a more and more viable consumer with spending power, taking into account how to win their hearts and minds should be at the heart of a brand's strategy.",3.5
"The first brand that came to my mind is Etsy. To be honest, I can't say much about the company itself, but I just love what they offer. The whole purpose of their business is to support smaller creators, makers and artists. I love their simple branding and their care for individuals as entrepreneurs. This is a marketplace that should live forever in spite of the Walmart's of the world.",1.5
"To earn my respect (and I also think the respect of most modern consumers) a brand needs to have deep respect for human rights, go beyond just being conscious of their environmental impact (trying to be sustainable, focus on recycling, using only organic / non-harmful materials, etc.), emphasize being ethical, and foster a safe and nurturing workplace for their employees. 
 This is like the new bar that has been set for any brand, this is the minimum a brand needs to do to be respectable. Beyond this minimum I find a strong brand identity and open transparency (with regards to how products are made and how the company is run) major bonus points. 
 
 I think Patagonia is maybe the most obvious example of a brand that exemplifies what I find respectable. I feel like they have really been leading the way in being an ethical and more sustainable brand. When I was living in Paris, I became a lot more aware of a fashion brand called S__ane that is super popular with Parisians. I had originally misjudged the label as just another mid-level fashion brand but came to discover that they have a pretty impressive sustainability program (including recycling efforts, being powered by renewable energy, reducing their carbon footprint, etc.) as well as a solid philanthropic program (Demain). S__ane just strikes me as a brand that is genuinely trying to help and put its success to good use.",3
"Live Tinted. I love this brand, its culture and the values of its founder, Deepica Mutyala. I admire this company as it is making waves and breaking all kinds of ceilings when it comes to fund raising by female CEOs, creating inclusive products, creating a fresh narrative for the next generation, it's choice of cruelty free and sustainable elements and it's cultural awareness. I feel like the future for businesses is one where the planet and all its people are prioritised over profit and that to me is refreshing!",1.5
"I admire Polo by Ralph Lauren from a marketing perspective. First of all, it is the aspired look the TV and social pressure made me eat while I was younger and during adolescence, but this preppy style can be seen on yuppies and even drug moguls in Mexico blurring the lines of demographics, establishing a sport as a lifestyle, even running over the Polo Club Association when they tried to open their own fragance line. For me this brand has earned my respect, when I see a piece of clothing from Polo I am sure it will last for a lot of years also.",1.5
"Levi's. Let's talk about them. 
 
 Here's an article from 2017, which called out Levi's for an advertisement that credited white men for the creation of music: https://www.buzzfeed.com/amberjamieson/levis-ad-credits-white-guys-for-music. Last year, Levi's came out with a public statement titled ""Levi's Diversity Problem- And Our Plan to Fix It,"" where they essentially addressed the root of their diversity problem- not having enough people of color with seats at the highest tables. They then committed to a plan to change this. 
 
 Levi's has always been something I've been neutral on as a brand. Being an American heritage brand can quickly become a representation of exclusivity and ostracism. I'm always wary whenever a heritage brand puts out messaging because it can easily cater to only one audience- which can create actually dangerous situations as we progress as a country. But a brand that can embrace its roots but root its messaging and purpose in the way we progress and achieve as a country is a brand that is doing something right. I've seen more diverse, inclusive advertising from Levi's and even the products themselves have taken cues from more progressive styles. Levi's also addressing their diversity problem is a big plus in my book- addressing the issue and creating an action plan to fix it is always how I advise brands to move forward. Accountability, action, and understanding are the three key tenets to showing up in 2021 and winning those hearts and minds we talked about earlier.",3.5
"Levi's comes to mind. It seems like they are thriving, as they always have. I imagine their success is a combination of sticking to what they're good at and reinventing denim. Somehow they can perfectly blend being vintage but modern. A pair of vintage Levi's is coveted, and yet they're also staying relevant on TV shows such as Making The Cut.",1.5
"A heritage brand to me means history. And actually, maybe more of an emphasis on ___story__ over time. A brand__s story or heritage adds a deeper level of connection for consumers but also gives it a certain credibility because it has withstood the test of time. 
 
 The first brand I think of is Dior because I just went to the Brooklyn Museum__s exhibition of Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, which displays the early history, legacy, and current state of this iconic house of design. The show really highlights the legacy of Mr. Dior himself, his inventiveness and signature ___new look__ but also demonstrates how the brand evolved as it was in the hands of various designers. 
 
 In terms of how the business is doing, after looking at a few sources, everything seems to agree that business for Dior was good in 2019 and that sales were up. I think this is largely due to their cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories but I also think that current designer, Maria Grazia Chiuri, is well liked and well reviewed. She honors the history of the brand but brings her own sensibilities as well as certain pieces that were massive hits for the brand: saddle bags, ___we should all be feminists__ t-shirts, double pearl tribale earrings, etc.",2.5
"Levi's. To me this brand is the epitome of timeless fashion. Every time you see a really good pair of jeans that is effortlessly cool you associate it to this classic brand. However, I feel like they could do more in terms of sustainability and innovation. It is common knowledge that denim production involves a lot of water consumption and it would be great if more efficient methods of production were demonstrated in terms of marketing and storytelling. We are experiencing a drought in California at the moment and I feel that consumers are very mindful about these aspects associated with the focus on climate change. I believe this would help them connect more with the younger consumers.",2.5
"The first brand that comes to my mind is Burberry. I link its heritage to their signature trench coat and mainly the tecnology of their fabrics. I don't believe they are doing too well. It happens that when creative talents exits a big brand, they usually takes with them all the leverage and attention. I understand Burberry's former CEO left for Salvatore some months ago. The pandemic also hit hard luxury brands, which resulted in new colaborations between heritage brands and ecommerce platforms (even with discounts). Heritage brands are trying to keep up but usually fall short when it comes to innovation, sustainability and knowing (and learning from) their target.",2.5

It is important for me to have access to public health services like doctor revisions and medicins,1

"In Mexico we call it ""gastos m__icos mayores"", which translate to mayor medical expenses, and what that includes is in case of an accident or a long term disease, the insurance that I pay for covers me. 
 Additionally, I also have IMSS , which is the Mexican Institute of Social Security, and I receive it thanks to my job. They pay a fee so that in case I need medical assistance due to an accident or disease, I'm covered. The good thing about this insurance is that if I suffer an accident on my way to my job or at my job o during any job activity, and need to be absent from my job for recovery, I'm financially covered. The bad thing is that it's no so good as a medical institution, hence I pay for a private one.",3

"Recently purchased a few ESDE Bags handmade in Dusseldorf Germany. I've long been an admirer of ESDE, for their level of craftsmanship. They are very much an artisanal line, that personally for me, stands for luxury with timeless designs that transcend trends. These bags are made with love, made to last. They are meant to be accompany its owner and will age beautifully thru use and time. They are very thoughtful and considered with their communication, in their online bag presentation and on their social media, sharing their process and journey. I resonate deeply with this brand, because it reflects my ethos, of buying less, more quality. That each bag will age and evolve, like me, as I transform.",3
"I think that luxury promises more than a product - It comes with additional meaning: heritage, history, extensive savoir-faire, quality, and an original perspective. This experience, the Dior exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, really felt like it captured the history of Dior in such a cool way. It was like walking through a timeline of the brand and getting to see how the house has evolved over the years and how it changed from designer to designer. I feel like this exhibition just really stands out in my mind because it felt like stepping into the world of Dior. It wasn__t just a retrospective, it was this immersive, beautiful experience. I think this exhibition was meticulous curated and highlighted many iconic gowns and looks while also focusing on things like craftsmanship behind each piece, there was an entire room of the patterns / sample shapes that were used to create the end pieces. This little peek behind the curtain is also part of a luxurious experience, getting a glimpse of what the petites mains made and seeing their expert knowhow is astonishing and feels special to me. This attention to details is something that screams luxury to me.",3
"Its one of the most streamlined businesses I've encountered. They have everything down pat. They clearly make an effort to employ exceptional people, but not just in the sense that they are good at their jobs on a practical level but that they really genuinely seem to care. They go one step beyond. Nothing is too much trouble and they always email you to follow up, find out how you are and make a few helpful additional suggestions.",2
"the experience was so special because I was in such a beautiful place and environment- visually inspiring and aspirational. also being made feel included, welcomed and at home made me feel more comfortable and at ease to enjoy the beauty around me. these three words capture the essence of what luxury is to me. luxury is not just a product but a way of life - a way to care for ourselves and to treat ourselves- we are all entitled to this and it should not be just for a specific class of people. everyone should be able to feel included and welcomed to enjoy a beautiful experience.",2.5
"Due to the effects of the pandemic, ESDE hasn't been able to participate in retail fairs and retail orders were being cancelled due to closures. Instead of going to a bank, they thought of crowdfunding directly with their following by offering a rare sale. I have become even more selective with my purchases, buy less, buy quality timeless pieces I will cherish. I was moved to support them, because I believe in their ethos of made to last, high quality that you can pass down like heirlooms. They also offer initialization as a complimentary option... with personal communication with me to make sure placement is exactly where i'd like it to be. I love the personal touch and that subtle details that only I know is there, is in the bags. I knew my purchase would last a lifetime and the notion of these bags aging beautifully, uniquely with me, excites me. They are quiet designs, that have character and integrity, and made with immense care.",2.5
"My most recent luxury experience was a nice and 17-day long trip to southern Spain with my boyfriend. We spent Christmas and New Year__s traveling around Madrid, Toledo, Cordoba, Sevilla, and Granada. This felt luxurious to me because I have never done such a long trip, we had the luxury of time! Being an American, I am accustomed to having short and jam-packed vacations due to the limited time off I previously had. Now, living in Europe and freelancing gives me a lot more time to play with for vacations. I justified this trip because with Covid I haven__t been traveling as much as I used to and I desperately missed doing so, travel is something I really treasure. I also had a huge work event that I had been organizing happen just before we left for Spain so I justified this big trip as a reward for making it through this very difficult project. I also really wanted to do a proper tour and see multiple cities but having the amount of time we did made everything feel relaxed and not rushed, which I loved! I didn__t feel guilty about being a bit lazy and sitting for hours in nice cafes or terraces, enjoying the sunshine, because I had more days in whichever city we were in at the moment. It just felt extra good and extra luxurious to be able to relax and not feel stressed about trying to do everything I wanted to in just a few days.",3
"I bought a pair of Penelope Chilvers Incredible pony boots for winter. People are always nagging me to buy sturdy walking shoes as I usually turn up in trainers or even worse, flip flops one time to climb a mountain in Mallorca. Plus I was going on a trip somewhere cold. I spent about 30 seconds justifying the purchase to myself. I realised that they would probably last me a decade or more so really, what is 400 quid when you look at it like that? If you're going to buy a fancy walking boot, buy a good one that you like - and these ones really are special and very admired.",2
"A 14K gold ring with a large onyx stone. I bought it because I had been admiring it for several months. it eventually sold out and I was disappointed about it as it was a really unique piece and unlike my other pieces of fine jewelry. it eventually came back in stock around the time of my 40th birthday. I tried it on and it looked great against my black diamond band ring that I had been wearing - I justified it because 1. I could afford it (I never want to have a credit card balance!) 2. it was a milestone birthday for me 3. it was the perfect size and looked great with the rings that I was already wearing and 4. because I loved it and felt connected to it! these are all important to me when purchasing luxury (or any) items. I want to be able to use them and they need to fit into my life- I never want to buy a luxury product that just sits in my closet unused because I am ""afraid"" to use it.",3
"My definition of luxury hasn't changed much, except more clarified. It has always been associated to the highest level of quality, care, attention, craft. I was never a big luxury label aficionado like Chanel, LV. Although I admire their ateliers and all the craftspeople they support, I am turned off by their mass appeal and global market share. Their bags also are not built to be indestructible / age-well. As I've matured, I'm more attracted to artisanal niche brands that are unrecognizable to most, but are quietly sharing their craft, their love. Personal human touch & attention is luxurious to me. Timelessness, quality, humbleness, personal connection are qualities I look for in luxury brands that truly resonates.",3.5
"My relationship with luxury has indeed changed over the years: I know now, after years of working in the fashion industry, that luxury doesn__t always mean quality. This is especially true of jewelry & leather goo, many luxury brands sell plated jewelry that ultimately flakes off for example. We__ve all seen the documentaries of high-end brands having terrible working conditions for the people making their products or doing cruel things like abusing animals - just because something is ___luxury__ doesn__t necessarily mean it is truly luxurious at every step of the design & production process. I guess my relationship with luxury has become more and more suspicious __¡° I__m hyper aware that a customer is mostly paying for the brand__s name and surround prestige rather than the materials & design of the product itself. So I do try to investigate the materials and the brand__s ethics more that I used to. 
 
 
 Items: I prefer luxury accessories, to me I do feel that clothing is so easy to wear and tear that I__d rather invest in more luxurious details like shoes & jewelry. I do think that perfume should be a luxurious experience and make you feel great when you wear it. I mix and match luxury and normal make up.
 
 Brands I buy into: old C__ine, The Row, A Day__s March, Tibi, Sally Lapointe 
 
 Aesthetics I love: Lanvin, Dior, Miu Miu, Christopher Kane",4
"It has absolutely evolved. Buying 'luxury' 100% now means asking questions of myself. What role will this item play in my life? Do I genuinely need it? Will it get used enough? It HAS to have a practical role in my life. I no longer believe in 'keeping things for best'. Use it or don't buy it. Furthermore, where does it come from? What are the brands creds? Do they look like they care? Do they *actually* care?",2
"it has evolved over time as I get older. I used to read fashion magazines and think that luxury meant being able to buy the most expensive bags in vibrant colors every season to stay on trend. now I realize that it is a very slow investment over time and that there really are no trends in true luxury items. the luxury to me - means that it is of highest and lasting quality - something that will be with me forever and will always be ""in style"". luxury doesn't mean owning a lot of things, rather slowly collecting overtime, items, people, experiences etc that create value and happiness to your life. it is also about having the ability to love yourself.",2.5
"Feeling secure is everything. 
 
 Security shows up in every aspect of someone__s life.
 
 Food insecurity = Your body can shut down without the right food. 
 Relationship insecurity = You can get beaten, or your kids can get beaten. 
 Housing insecurity = You may need to live on the streets or in your car. 
 Educational insecurity = You don__t have access to basic education in order to move up in the world. 
 Race Insecurity = You fear for your safety simply because of the color of your skin. 
 
 At the end of the day, these are all basic fundamental human rights, the bottom rungs on the ladder. They form the foundation of a happy and fulfilled life. Without them, one can never progress up the ladder and fulfill one__s potential. 
 
 The ground that the ladder sits on is financial security. Without it, you wouldn__t even have a ladder.",2.5
"If I feel secure I can focus my energy and attention on growing as a person, I can enjoy life freely. If I don't feel secure for some reason, whether it is financial or emotional security, I will have that noise in the back of my mind and won't be able to perform as I want or should. One example of emotional security regarding my children is when they were very little. I was very picky with whom I left my children. It made a world of difference. If I was totally comfortable with the person taking care of them while I was out of home I felt secure, happy and could enjoy my time out or perform my tasks professionally. When I am struggling financially I cannot think of my new project, at least I cannot put in the energy I want on it, I go to bed thinking of how I am going to pay my bills. 
 For example, if I was driving a car I don't feel safe in, my focus would go in the wrong direction, I would be worried about the car breaking down or crashing instead of enjoying the drive or using that time to think of plans or other important things. 
 Feeling secure makes a world of difference to me. Feeling secure affects every aspect of my life.",2.5
"My security is everything as it pertains to my physical health, mental health and overall happiness. The impact that security has on my physical self is high especially in light of the challenges brought on my the Covid 19 pandemic and the continued fight for equality that myself and my fellow black children, men and women face in our country. I want myself and my family to feel physically secure within our environment and community and not have to feel threatened by law enforcement every time we walk out the door to start our days. This in turn ties into the impact my physical security desires has on my mental being as well. Having mental security to me means being able to move about my environment with less stress and worry about factors that can be controlled. Factors such as police profiling me because of my skin color, for example. These securities would make a drastic difference into my perception of security and how it correlates with my life.",2.5
"As the kids would say, YOLO. (Do they still say that!?) But for real, we only have this life, so we must take hold of it, make the most of it and enjoy it to the fullest. 
 
 I want to feel secure to find comfort in my choices and to thrive in the paths that I choose. 
 
 In wellness, it's important to me to feel secure because self care allows you to be your best self, gives you more energy and is a great stress buster thus better for providing for others, namely my children. I have learned that if I do not love myself first, I cannot be the best mother to my children. I need to take the time to be physically active, read, have some personal time away from the family dynamics in order to be able to perform my duties (do to speak) as a mother and wife. 
 
 It's important to feel secure in my relationships because I want to have a connection with the people I choose to share my time with. There needs to be purpose revolving our relationships. My husband and I have talk about this all the time, we feel that if there isn't anything we gain out of friendships, then what is the point? Our time is precious so we should make sure who we spend our time with is one that has meaning and a future. 
 
 It's important to me to feel secure in my finances as we are a nation where it is expensive to live. We don't need many 'things' but to have security around income to be able to provide for a growing family is a must. Part of taking care of yourself, means you do things that you enjoy, so you need finances for that as well. Knowing that you have job security means you can plan ahead for things to enjoy.
 
 Finding security in all these areas just makes me feel safe and I want to be able to be present in the moment in all the moments in my life and knowing that I feel safe in these areas will allow me to feel more free in those moments.",3
"For me, financial security is the foundation of feeling secure. No matter how much I have in the bank, there must be money rolling in. This came about from observing the lifestyles and emotions on one side of my family who survived on welfare to the other side who lived as doctors and lawyers. I saw that food insecurity, relationship insecurity, housing insecurity, and educational insecurity were all tied to financial security. One side of the family had it; the other did not. 
 
 Our personal goal was to work and then retire. It was supposed to be one on-off spigot in our lifetime. You work (money in); you retire (money out). We made career decisions and life tradeoffs to ensure that this formula held. There were not supposed to be lapses in this formula. Having gone through corporate mergers and other events has led to the on-off switch being not just a one-time event, but a multiple time event. Jobs have gone away, and the spigot changes to off. These are the moments when feeling secure is a higher priority. We are way luckier than most. We have made decisions to be able to maintain our lifestyle by tapping into the savings. Still, it creates an incredible unease, especially when the future looks like it does today.",2.5
"Feeling secure of having a roof is certainly a priority. I am lucky enough to own my house, so that is not a priority I need to attend to but is certainly a priority in my list of important things to focus on. 
 Feeling secure of having a good medical insurance is a priority, for myself and my children. 
 When life hits hard, feeling emotianlly secure, having a good support system is a priority to me. My youngest son was detected a tumor in May and is undergoing chemotherapy at the moment. Of course my first priority is his recovery and finding good doctors and the best treatment. But once I had that secured, the emotional support of my friends meant the world to me. My connection to them, feeling their love and seeing how they would instantly go out of their way to help was so important to my gaining strength to overcome this situation.",3
"These current times are a big ___moment__ in life for me because as a black man in America, my security is being attacked/compromised/under siege by multiple factors at once. The racism, systemic or direct, is something that my people have been dealing with for lifetimes now. The collision of that and it__s current fever pitch coupled with the uncertainty and worry about a disease that has disproportionately affected melanted people has caused me to magnify the level of priority I put on security. It__s coming from all angles and the anxiety brought from having this high priority of security makes me daily redefine what feeling secure looks like to me.",2
"I think as I age, the more this becomes a priority. The realization that this is the only life we have to live is becoming more and more clear the older I get. We really need to ensure that we are set up for our future. 
 
 My relationship with my husband has grown so much over the past years we have been together. We have grown so much together, both through our minds and our souls. The knowledge we have gained over the years has helped shape the paths we have taken to get where we are today. We understand that one day, our children will grow up and move on, it will just be him and I again. This is why it's important to have built that security early on. We are a team together. 
 
 I think prioritizing feeling secure is a positive thing that more people need to do. It's like an investment for yourself. Invest in things that are important to you and they will take care of you the rest of your life. 
 
 I prioritized my health after having two children ( it may have taken a bit longer than I had planned, but it's a journey right!?) I knew that I would need to be able to keep up with them. I started to be more aware of what I was doing to and feeding my body to ensure I was maximizing my health. So, now I am definitely feeling more secure in my own body and am able to 'be' in those moments with my kids and plan to keep going at their pace.",2
"My biggest worry is not being able to land another job while the country is rebuilding. I think that companies may realize (true or not) that the at-home productivity is higher than when people went to the office. This may permanently result in fewer jobs. Also, having let so many people go, a company__s financial statements may not allow them to re-hire quickly; it may take time. 
 
 Lastly, I am on the more ___experienced__ and probably more expensive side of the labor pool. What I envision is people hiring young people that don__t have the experience base, because they ___can__. 
 How it impacts my life? I am networking, chatting with recruiters, and exploring setting up a little consulting gig.",2
"Currently I must say that my biggest worry is my financial situation. I am a translator and whenever I do a job my clients are satisfied and happy. My work is well appreciated (by no means I am saying that I am perfect). Nevertheless, the workflow is low and I end up struggling to pay my bills. I have a hard time finding a solution to this. 
 My financial situation impacts every aspect of my life: I cannot afford vacations, I cannot travel with my children or buy them the things I would like to, and most of the times I cannot afford giving my friends gifts I would love to. Needless to say, my bills sometimes pile up and that does affect my sense of security and makes me feel worried a great part of my day (and night).",3
"My biggest worry is that my son is going to be fighting the same battles for freedom, justice and equality that I, his grandfather and great grandfather had to fight as well. This impacts my life tremendously because I want him to live in a world where he really can enjoy being himself, a black man, without having to have his spider senses up constantly due to the color of his skin.",2
"I'm not sure I mentioned this in the first set of questions related to insecurities but now that I think about it more....
 
 Parenting. Parenting has to be one of the hardest, draining, emotional and sacrificial things I have ever had to do, and the hard part is only begining. I have a daughter and a son. A daughter who is 9 going on 15. The hardships she is starting to go through will be streneous on us parents. I fear that we will make the wrong mistakes, won't be able to help her make the right choices or create some sore of barrier between us and our relationship. I have those same fears for my son, but he is younger (6) and he hasn't faced any adversity yet. 
 
 My insecurities for this, I believe come from the flaws that I have developed as a young person and continue to work on improving but you know, they sneak up on you and your children see, and witness, then adopt and become eventually, which is really scary. 
 
 I really hope that as my children grow I am able to help them to see that people are always growing and can be better people the more they know and the more they take care of themselves.",3
"Fidelity Investments. Their core offerings are retirement plans that you don__t have to think about much. The money goes in and stays there. It screams, ___don__t touch this!__ They basically force you to be financially secure once you really need it __¡° when you are retired and have no or little money coming in. There are offerings based on your age and where you are on your financial journey.",2.5
"The first thing that came to my mind is probably not a brand in itself but it is a health insurance company. Having a good healthcare plan in case of an emergency makes me feel secure. 
 If it were a car, BMW is a brand that makes me feel safe.",3
"Hmm I would say if it__s on the basis of the kind of securities I__m talking about, I would say HBO as a brand. They have always had content that break the barriers of race and gender that invoke conversation that helps us as a people move forward through enlightenment and education.",1.5
"So, I had a hard time with this because I am not one to stick to certain brands or have a love for any certain brand in particular. 
 
 When making a purchase, I will usually do a bit of research into what brand to choose, especially if the purchase is of a significant amount. Things I like to consider are, where it's made, what are the materials/ingredients they use, quality of the product and the cost. 
 
 However, I do use a line of skin care products and household products that I truly trust. They are Canadian and stand behind their brand. The Green Beaver Company. They use all natural ingredients to allow safe products for everyone including the environment. I believe this company is a good investment for my family.",2.5
"(1) I am now working from home full time rather than from my office. This change is both positive and negative. I like not having to commute but it is definitely more isolating and I find myself working longer hours; (2) I had to cancel many trips I had for this year and I have not been able to travel to see my family on the other side of the country, which has been a bummer",2
"1) I suddenly put health at the forefront of my life. Prior to March 2020, my personal health and well-being was always the last thing on my mind. Physically, I would always say that I was too busy to get a doctor's visit in or schedule a check-up. Mentally, I never prioritized checking in on myself and making sure my mental well-being was where I wanted it to be. COVID really shifted my perspective on how important self-care TRULY is and the true way to achieve self-care. COVID shut down one of the jobs I was working at and I suddenly found myself questioning why I devoted my time where I did and what exactly self care truly looked like.
 
 2) My perspective on what I needed in my life changed. Prior to COVID, I thought that I needed to be working 70+ hours a week and attending school full-time in order to feel like the full version of myself. I thought I needed to jam my schedule with everything and anything to stay busy and productive. It wasn't until the COVID shutdowns that I stepped back and realized that what I needed the most to feel whole was to spend time with the people I love, and to also spend time with myself. This means small things, like binge watching Korean dramas on a Friday night, or game night with my partner on a random Thursday. I now know, and may have always known, that I don't need to fill 
 
 3) I put equity & racial justice at the forefront of my life. I currently work in Equity & Community Engagement full-time and have ALWAYS been passionate about racial justice and equitable access, but COVID-19 brought out so many new injustices that I now know I will spend the rest of my life and career fighting for a better, more equitable world. From the way I was treated as a Chinese American woman, to the hardships my communities faced, both racially and financially, during this pandemic, fighting for this ""better world"" is at the forefront of my thoughts every day. Watching the minority communities in my native Queens struggle to feed their families, and then the next minute reading about how the billionaires of the world were becoming trillionaires because of the pandemic is a haunting experience and I don't know how I can remain quiet and passive when the world returns to a ""post-COVID"" state.",3
"For me, life involving the pre-and-post pandemic era started to change for me towards the end of 2019. I work in the airline industry and I had started to hear about an outbreak in China around November via internal communications. We were slowly being prepped for disruption to our flights to China and I believe by January, we had cut our flights to Asia drastically. Now again, from the perspective of work, we were not worried about the effects this would have on our total operations because we had dealt with SARS a few years back and the company/industry was currently using that model to gauge this new coronavirus. That all changed in about mid-to-late February when we started to get reports now of the coronavirus being in the US. By about March 16th, our airport, which was just ranked the most busiest airport in the world just the year prior, was literally a ghost town. I have never seen it look so surreal. By the end of that month, my hours were cut 85%. By the beginning of April, I knew at least two people personally that contracting what was know being called covid-19. I still was going into work and I live in Chicago so commuting through downtown was like watching the scenes in The Terminator when Skynet took over earth. Seeing that there were no people walking around the usually busy downtown streets was like being in a hazy, lucid dream state. By May, everything was virtually shutdown here and I had been ""deemed"" an essential worker by the government so I had to carry a badge that stated so, just in case I would get questioned by the police during my commute. Real police state stuff. Also, the schools here were trying their best here to piece together some kind of semblance of a classroom experience so my son and I were trying our best to get down a routine, learn how to use the google classroom and maintain our sanity. I was now at home from work literally 80% of the time from the reduction in my hours and also trying to facilitate my son with his school work. So trying to figure all of this out only got even more challenging to me on May 25th when George Floyd was murdered by the police. Again, I live in Chicago, on the Southside in particular. I am a black man with a black son and I have always been aware of my status as it relates to my race in this country. The protests in this city mirrored that of what saw across the world and the preceding riots affected my neighborhood directly. The mounting mental strain on me was becoming unreal. It was like I was waking up to the most absurd movie that reality could impose but that I had to get through each of these circumstances everyday. It was like a videogame and the prize was being able to just get home safely. In July, as I thought things could not get any worse, I got a call at work that my best friend of 20 years passed away. This is a person I literally conversed with in some shape or form everyday for the majority of that 20 year union. I am still trying to articulate this and how it could happen in concert of the tumultuous nature of this year. So, in a nutshell it is difficult for me to explain only 2-3 things that changed my life this year without giving a proper context in my timeline of events. I, as well as many others, have been affected in multiple ways and the immeasurable changes endeared will be with me for the rest of my physical life.",3
"Covid has drastically changed our family's life since March. We were previously an incredibly active, busy and social family, constantly on the go (kids sports games, practices, both of us working 9-6pm, having dinner parties with friends at least once a week). We barely saw our children as they were in afterschool til 6pm, and between dinner and homework we usually only had 10 minutes to spend with them on weekdays. Initially the primary feeling/thoughts that came up for us with quarantine was panic (""aaaagh how the heck are we going to work with these 2 rascals home all day?!"" ""If I have to hang out with only my kids all day I'm going to go CRAZY"" ""What are going to do with just each other?!). But then after the initial month of figuring out logistics and settling in, I began to notice that our family was having some positive experiences that we never would have otherwise, such as having lunch at home for the first time, having time for daily exercise, and having special rituals to ""spice up"" our week such as Saturday night sleepovers where we sleep in the kids tiny bedroom in their bunkbeds, and spend a few hours doing ""family fun time"" and coming up with crazy challenges to do. I realize now that before we may have been filling our schedules out of anxiety--almost a fear that we wouldn't get along without distracting ourselves with friends or activities.",3
This is my desk in my office - I haven't been there since March!,2
"Neon flowers. Cute to look at, and not much different from the real thing in this context. But truthfully, they're nothing compared to real flowers. This is how I feel like I lived my life prior to COVID, with everything looking great on the outside, and with my thinking that I understood ""self care,"" but it's nothing compared to the REAL deal. Neon flowers can't grow and nothing you add to it nurtures or changes the flower. This is representative of an unsustainable lifestyle, where I didn't have time to dedicate to my passions and those around me that I love.",4
This is what downtown Chicago typically looks like on my commute to and from work,2
"Son in organized sports. Our ""spending time"" with them was watching them do an activity not with us. We were always driving them to practice and games.",2.5
This is my makeshift home office in the guest room! It's a pretty nice setup but it does get lonely.,2
"These are real flowers: bright, vibrant, and ready to continue growing and blossoming. They're starkly different from the neon flowers from before- they are just not the same. These flowers obviously are taken care of, vibrant and will continue to grow under the proper care. This is how I currently feel- as though all the self care and growth that occurred just in the past 6 months alone have transformed me not into an entirely different person, but a better version of myself.",4
This is what downtown chicago and parts of my neighborhood look like now,2
"This is a picture we took during our Saturday sleepovers, and one week we did a human pyramid challenge and wore matching mickey mouse shirts we had made for our Disney cruise (which got cancelled obviously). It was so much fun!",3
"The change with the biggest impact has been not being able to travel or to see my family. In addition, I will add that I have been getting very little facetime with friends either. I think this has definitely been hurting my mental state, but I hope it doesn't have any long-term consequences. One thing it has done has teach me not to take spending time with family/friends for granted.",2
"I grew up experience racial discrimination, and it increased tenfold when COVID began. I was surrounded by it everyday- whether that meant when I ventured outside to buy groceries or when I was aimlessly scrolling through Twitter. The blatant tolerance for racism towards Asian Americans is something I never thought I could conquer. But because of my experiences over the past 6 months, my resolve to dedicate my career and the rest of my life to fighting for a world where I don't have to explain this situation to you, has increased tenfold. I've also now surrounded myself with a community of like-minded individuals: individuals who will not stand for the racial injustice not just towards my community, but towards all people of color and marginalized populations. I am not one of those people who has to question her career choice and whether what she does everyday for a living actually makes an impact on anyone else's life.",2.5
"The death of my friend because I thought we would be here longer together physically and able to enjoy the spoils of wisdom with aging. Now I am trying to be a better, purposeful human and do the most enrichment while I am here physically. In the future, I plan to represent myself and my friend in a positive and civilized manner and bring life and hope to others through my actions in some way.",2.5
"It's more of an emotional change, the movement away from old anxiety that I had that we needed to fill our schedules to get along better as a family. I think I was almost afraid to spend time with just them, that they would be bored and act out. But now I understand that they are perfectly happy to spend time just with us, and we as a family are perfectly capable of coming up with ways to enjoy each other's company. I won't feel anxious about scheduling hangouts with other families every weekend, and will definitely plan in some family nights like family sleepovers to continue the bonding.",3
"I have been disappointed in the travel industry in general because I feel like they have been running sales and encouraging risky behavior. I understand these businesses are doing what they need to do to survive, but people should not be encouraged to go on plane/cruise vacations right now. One brand I'll call out in particular is Frontier Airlines for pushing a sale during the height of the pandemic in April.",2
"Google ""Lululemon: China."" I can't even pick one incident or article to describe to you here- it's like a ""choose your own adventure"" game. I'm not just disappointed in Lululemon- I'm disappointed in everyone who continues to support the brand, but will boycott brands that don't speak out against Black Lives Matter. It clearly shows me who is a true ally against racial injustice and who likes to wear racism to Equinox. I'm greatly disappointed in the fact that Lululemon continues to flourish despite its employees promoting ""Bat Fried Rice"" attire, its own CEO telling people that he chose the brand's name because he thinks it's ""funny"" to watch Japanese people try- and fail- to pronounce the word. Take a look for yourself: https://nextshark.com/chip-wilson-lululemon-japanese-pronunciation/",3
"Facebook because the owner seems to be operating and has been operating for some time with an allegiance only to his financial bottom line and not the true bottomline of humanity. From all the Cambridge Analytica data activity to the lack of accountability over damaging/galvanizing political post policing, Zuckerberg actions (or lack thereof) appears to be exacerbating an already volatile social environment.",2.5
"The cruise lines industry as a whole. We had a cruise booked in mid-March and were following them closely, and I felt disappointed in their avoidance of responsibility until many people started dying from Covid on their ships and then they were finally compelled to cancel. Their messaging was confusing (""we care about our customers safety"" yet not cancelling, ""we are being really safe with xyz protocols"" yet having customers spend time in common areas). It was so clear that they were more interested in money than people's lives.",2.5
"I've been impressed with Nike because their ads have been relevant and timely, both in the face of the pandemic and the racial protests. The brand stands for what it believes in and their messages were not overly promotional.",2
"Prabal Gurung. Not just the brand itself, but the man behind the brand. Prabal Gurung is an Asian ethnic minority and has been outspoken against the racial injustice that occurs in America since before it was a trend this year. For years, Gurung has dedicated his fashion to speaking up for minorities and people of color who cannot elevate their own voices, and quietly, but strongly donated money, created brand lines centered around advocacy, and used his platform to champion the fight for racial justice. I'm proud to support this Asian man of color and will continue to stand by his brand. https://prabalgurung.com/blogs/the-journal/prabal-gurung-re-releases-stronger-in-colour-collection-to-benefit-the-bail-project-in-support-of-black-lives-matter",2.5
"The NBA has been the best brand to me personally that is putting their platform to positive use for fighting for the rights of and actions of Black people in this country. They have continued the dialogue of why black lives matter and have been supportive in letting the players, coaches, analysts regularly share their input during the telecasts.",2
"I recently watched a commercial from 3M, who I always thought of for masking tape. They acknowledged that in their commercial (which I thought was smart because it reinforces their main brand product) but then also educated the public on all that they have been doing for coronavirus, specifically shifting their production to make PPE products like masks and ventilators to save lives. I was impressed with their ability to be flexible in this time but also walked away from the commercial feeling like they are committed to public safety and the common good of humankind, not just their product.",3
"To me, living an active lifestyle is similar to what it was before this year, though the way that many people stay active has changed. Instead of crowding into indoor gyms, more people are working out from home or focusing on outdoor activities. I am fortunate that I have been able to continue doing my favorite fitness activities like running, biking, and tennis throughout the pandemic.",2
"It depends on what lens you look at the word ""active"" through. If it's through an equity lens, then leading an active lifestyle means building your community through mutual aid networks, volunteering to elevate the underserved, championing equal access to resources, etc. If it's through a racial justice lens, then this means no longer staying silent. This also means going beyond the stage performance- continuing the fight even when you are backstage and the cameras stop rolling. It means racial justice for ALL people of color- not just those who you choose to befriend or love. If you're talking about an active lifestyle through the lens of entertainment and the ""lighter things in life,"" then we don't have much of it these days- concerts, parties, movies, etc. I would suggest that those who are looking for an ""active lifestyle"" in 2020 turn to creating an ""active lifestyle for equity"" or an ""active lifestyle for racial justice.""",3
"Hmm that could be being actively involved in protesting systemic racism, police brutality and other oppressions faced by the minorities in the country and around the world. It also could mine activating your true energy in this time of chaos by finding peace in something that you were meant to do with your time and not what you have been doing to get paid.",2
"The same is to be exercising and moving your body. Different is how exactly we do that. For our family adults used to go to the gym several times a week, kids had organized sports and had PE at school. Now I do youtube videos every morning before I start my work, and take walks with my husband after work. These things have become ritualized, and it feels just as much as emotional wellness as it is physical wellness. I may be wrong but I am way more fit than before Covid. What may be forever changed is the idea that we only ""go workout"" at gyms. The idea of gyms feels silly now, when I can get just as good as a workout at home where I don't have to get in the car to go there, and I can do 10 minute sections on parts I want to focus on.",3
"Although I miss the gym and fitness classes I used to go to, I am still enjoying exercising outside in a safe way.",2
"It's a high standard that most people who do not come from marginalized backgrounds or who do not identify as a person of color will not understand. To be passive these days is to be complicit, and to be active for the show of it and till the energy runs out is not going to make a difference. I sometimes have high hopes that often deflate when I think of how much work we still have left to do.",2.5
I feel it's the time to be the best you can and want to be. Its the first time in my life time witnessing a cataclysmic shift in energy so profound that I would be remised to squander this opportunity to be more involved in myself and the universal opportunity to help others,2.5
"I feel great about it. I think the idea that kids and adults can exercise on their own, in their house, will allow for more exercise time than having to go somewhere.",2
"I am quite relaxed relation to food and I kind of eat everything except intestine. I eat everything, however when I cook myself, I only make vegetarian food or seafood. And as long as I regularly do some kind of sports I can eat sweets too. I enjoy trying new things which means that I buy a lot of strange food just to try it. As long as I don't eat more calories than I burn I don't have any specific diet related to health. (I suppose I sound like all other millennials :) )",2.5
"My approach is all about balance and not seeing any food type as ___bad__ or ___good__. I don__t calorie count and I don__t make myself feel bad if I have a cookie or do a workout to compensate. 
 
 My key principles are:
 
 1. Choose foods that enhance my physical body and mind i.e. have a holistic benefit e.g. home made fruit smoothies made from scratch where I know the ingredients and they promote overall wellness e.g. ginger (which I try and consume everyday) to reduce colds and boost my immune system; carrots (to improve eyesight) etc. 
 2. Take supplements if I need them e.g. Lysine (I get cold sores) and vitamin supplements in winter
 3. Eat the cookie, if you feel like a cookie. To be honest, if you are going to eat something ""unhealthy"". Go for something very unhealthy. I do believe a lot of products are being marketed with ""nonsense"" claims and health quotes and the foods that are perceived as being the most unhealthy probably are not. 
 4. Check where your food comes from - if you can__t make it from scratch (which is difficult when you are travelling or super busy), check the label but go for what you know e.g. . How much sugar is in the food? instead of looking for the presence of fancy ingredients e.g. exotic superfoods
 5. Choose food that is aligned to your values e.g. uses sustainable packaging, minimises/does not use palm oil and so on.",2.5
"A thoughtful, broad-minded approach with potentially a slight underlying anxiety and hypochondriac nature driving some decisions. Easily sucked into 'superfood' marketing spiel, however, very much interested in the wonderful benefits to food available to me. They would probably describe me as a curious foodie, there's less than a handful number of things I really dislike or won't eat. People often remark on the colourful, multi-cultural array of foods I either make myself or will buy when eating out. I'm never one to just go for the same, tried and trusted meal on a menu for instance. My approach to what substitutes as 'good' and what substitutes as 'bad' has somewhat shifted over the past 5 or 6 years and my attitude is a lot more relaxed now, albeit with much more interest in sustainable choices and #zerowaste way of life. My old approach to eating was perhaps more focused on weight loss goals than a more holistic approach to wellbeing, which it now is. I guess reaching my 30s has made me much less bothered about the shape of my belly, more how satisfied and healthy I feel inside!",3
"Oh god it can be just so confusing! I love food but o tend to like the wrong things. I have to work really really hard at what I eat. I think my most honest answer would be that I don__t have key principles. But it__s so hard - eat a range of different grains, two portions of oily fish a day, reduce your meat, avocados are now running Mexican drug cartels, demand for coconuts are destroying the forest! 
 
 I guess I just try for balance. Try not to be greedy (so hard), try not to indulge all the time (forgot about that at Xmas) make sure I eat more veg than anything else, and try to remember to take my vitamins.
 
 I__ve also done an awful lot of work personally this year and identified that I__m a compulsive eater - it__s linked so strongly to my emotions. I__ve spoken to a lot of my friends they__ve been so supportive, but I__ve been shocked to hear the complicated relationships they have had or still struggle to have woth food. So I guess awareness of that is becoming a key principal - am
 I hungry, why am
 I eating.",3
"I will ask myself the following questions to myself as a way to check-in with myself. 
 
 When I have a craving, I try to take a moment to understand why I am having the craving. Is it because I__m lacking sleep or feeling stressed? Do I need to eat or am I hydrated? 
 
 When I__m making food choices we (partner and I) will make sure that we are ready for the new week ahead by having the ingredients for quick meals, bulk cooking and a good pantry at the weekend. We have a weekly vegetable box to try out new variety of seasonal vegetables. 
  
 I will also ask the questions like: 
 What makes me feel energised? 
 Have I eaten the rainbow today or need top up? 
 Have I eaten a range of food with balanced portions? E.g abundance of vegetables, protein in every meal 
 
 Having the 80% rule of eating well and 20% for eating out or in social settings",3
"Balanced. My approach to food and diet has definitely improved significantly since having children. I__ve always been very active, playing a number of sports to county & national level at school, so I__ve never had to worry about my weight. This allowed me to eat my fair share of crap food though! Since having kids and getting slightly older (37) I__ve become a lot more educated about nutrition and aware of what we as a family eat. I__d say I__m very healthy without denying myself the pleasure of the foods I like. I__ve cut back on dairy and red meat in the last few years, I had a brief stint at being vegan last year too. While I enjoyed it, it was a pain having to prepare different food for me and the family who weren__t going vegan, so instead for ease we__ve met half way and more of our meals are plant based. I still love my chocolate, red wine and steak on a Saturday night!",2.5
"Good time to ask. It's January and I ended December overweight according to both my wife and the NHS. Consequently I'm not doing intermittent fasting (only eating during 8 hours of the day) and have dramatically reduced my carb intake (bye-bye pasta, rice, potatoes, cake and bread). This is extreme, and consequently extremely unpalatable __¡° however, I've lost a stone since the new year. So, elements of the regime will persist after I've got to my ideal weight __¡° I'm actually enjoying the discipline, I just need to have pastry back in my life. And chips, every now and again.",3
I ate more meet and cared less about what I ate. I was poorer as a student and didn't pay for premium products the way I am doing today.,2
"10 years ago I would be calorie counting. 
 
 My relationship with food wasn__t great. I would be super healthy, crack and then eat way too much chocolate or pizza. I wasn__t balanced at all. 
 
 I believed that low fat was good for me. Even though a lot of low fat food contains sugar. I saw carbs as bad. 
 
 I think I was eating about 1,500-1,800 calories a day 10 years ago but it was unhealthy food that made up those calories. 
 
 I do think these days it is much easier to eat healthily and there is more healthy food to eat on-the-go, which I do a lot. 
 
 For example, these days there are more raw vegan places and places where you can make specific changes to your meals. 
 
 There are products like Graze and Innocent Smoothies that are healthier alternatives to sodas and chocolate bars for eating on-the-go that are part of meal deals in the UK and are available at supermarkets. Although, maybe Innocent Smoothies are not the best example, but I still think there is healthier food available.",2.5
"At the age of 21, I was more concerned with the fun in other areas of my life than what I was consuming. However, I certainly embraced more short-term faddy eating trends at this age, with the aim of feeling slimmer and attractive. I have never been in a position of obsessing over food choices, but I did go through a longer period of very low carb around this time which will have affected my approach to food as a whole massively at the time. The one thing that's remained the same however since that age is my love of entertaining people with food. There's a certain type of contentment felt from nourishing others with food and good conversation (and booze), so this is a 'grown-up' aspect to my personality that I probably tried to take on around that age when first living properly away from home.",2.5
"So much easier!!! I would have tried to get my 5 a day, and really not given it much more thought. Aimed for a bit of balance, tried to eat meat that was well reared (which I still do) and that was it. I wouldn__t have had to block out all the crap that__s talked about today, or really have to think for myself if what I__m being told is truthful or not. Everyone could see ___dr__ Gillian mckeith was a quack right?!",3
"I wasn__t aware of how to be healthy in a sustainable and enjoyable way. I had a lot of bad habits that I might have not been aware of. If I did recognise them, I didn__t know how to change them. As a result, I was really burned out and physically ill and fatigue. I was overwhelmed and didn__t know how to help myself. This was a significant transformation for me",2
10 years ago I__d say I was a lot less educated about nutrition. I find the whole subject fascinating and I really believe that good food and a good diet has a huge impact not only on physical health but mental health. I think having kids was a huge catalyst. Why would I want to put anything rubbish into their bodies. I want them to be fit and strong and I want to be fit and strong for them and myself too. I suppose I have a greater respect for my body now. I didn__t give it much thought when I was younger,2.5
"Ten years ago: ""I eat what the f*** I want!""
 
 I got older. And a little bit fatter. And I realised that as I entered the second half of my life that I didn't want that second half to become increasingly limited by making dumbass dietary choices or by managing stress by binge eating a family pack of chocolate digestives.",3
Partly because I have a much higher income today and partly because I have been affect by different trends. First of all it is the trend regarding climate change awareness. There is also a trend where it is kind of a status to be able to take care of oneself. Another trend that has been going on for a couple of years is the status in knowing a lot about the food you are eating.,3
"Now I am more educated. Being close to 40 than 30, I am more conscious of what I eat and the impact on my wellbeing. I am not trying to crash diet.
 
 I guess being self employed now, I don__t want to get sick. So, more of my dietary choices are based on prevention for the short and long-term. I do yoga and meditate every day. Another thing is I am doing Dry January with a plan to quit alcohol. My brother had a serious health scare recently due to alcohol. This was a huge blow and made me really rethink my lifestyle.",2.5
"I think it's been a combination of inner contentment in terms of my body image developing as I've grown, plus society's growing emphasis on wellbeing allowing me more insight and knowledge to make wiser choices, to make me feel healthier and happier in the long run. There's also simply more choice available now, we have access to so many different global ingredients now even in the local supermarket, so it's no wonder that my approach to food and diet has shifted and become more integral to daily life.",2.5
Culture and being fed different and evolving (and often unproven) ideas. I think we__ve become a nation that__s obsessed! It__s getting to the point where the market is flooded with experts so it__s very difficult to pick your way through. I__ve been horrified by the number of my intelligent friends taken in by the likes of Madeline Shaw who have written books based on opinion not science.,3
"My body hit rock bottom and was taking sick days, in pain a lot that I had to change my eating lifestyle habits. I was living in China at the time, experiencing culture shock but at the same time I found a health coach and attended a few of her workshops which significantly helped",2.5
"I want to maintain good health for both me and for my children, so I can carry on living my life to the full for as long as possible. I want to set my kids a good example of what a healthy lifestyle is too so that they hopefully make good choices when they__re independent. I think I__ve taken a greater interest in articles published about diet and nutrition and I__m always trying to look at ways of improving or adding to our diet to maximise our health",2.5
"My wife.
 That sounds simplistic, but it's probably true. Left to my own devices, I tend to be self-indulgent with food (qv. chocolate digestives), with someone you love telling you that you might a little bit disgusting, there is motivation to, if not change, at least reconsider.",1.5
"Better is a subjective concept and it depends upon the context, which means I would say that it means awareness and giving people transparent information and choices for choosing the right product.",2
"Making better food choices is all about eating food that is good for your body and mind. For example, honey is good at providing slow release energy and essential minerals, and calming your nerves. 
 
 I also think making better food choices is a bit more than this. It is about choosing food products that are good for society and the environment as well. For example, choosing products without unsustainable palm oil. 
 
 A specific example are the Lemonaid+ drinks. I like the fact that they are really low sugar and taste great. I also like the fact that they are in recyclable glass bottles and by buying their products you donate money to projects benefiting the growers of the drink. 
  Also, making better food choices is about not relying too much on imported food with environmental and social consequences. For example, avocado production in Mexico is thought to be damaging the environment (through deforestation and travel by plane) and funding Mexican drug cartels. 
 
 While we can__t totally rely on local sourcing, local sources should not be dismissed for a trendy exotic ""fad"". I read somewhere that raspberries are just as good as acai berries as a super food, so why import exotic berries when local produce is just as good. 
 
 I am still cynical about things like coconut water and feel like it is just a new trend.",3
"It means two things. 1) Accepting that some food choices ultimately lead to a negative effect on my body and wellbeing in terms of energy levels, bloating, skin health and mental health and 2) Understanding the ways that certain foods at certain times of day or the month can help support different needs in the body. The more in tune I am to my body and allowing myself anything to satisfy or balance those needs is the key to happiness overall.",2.5
"Here we go again! It__s so many things
 
 It still means buying higher welfare or organic where i can afford it. 
 It means balance and a little treat every now and again
 It means my 5 a day - that one has really stuck!
 It means eating regular and well portioned meals and listening to my body to see when it__s full or hungry
 And within these limits, it means tasty and enjoyable! That__s the most important bit for me in anything I eat.
 Ooh, and a little bit of whole grain too - but still not sure about whole-wheat pasta as it__s gross and claggy. I persevere",3
"Having variety and an abundance of vegetables and fruits 
 
 Being able to listen to your own body what it needs to fuel you in different seasons and situations. 
 
 Being able to find your own balance as all bodies are different. 
 
 Feeling empowered with food choices by substituting better alternatives whether it__s going out and identifying emergency food places, ingredients, that are still nourishing and an attitude of being creative and experimenting",3
"It means exactly that. Looking to make healthy choices the majority of the time. Some days it__s ok to indulge but we have to look at what we__re broadly eating to make sure that our nutritional needs are met and that we consume foods that are going to benefit us. So looking at foods with less sugar, less salt, fewer additives, looking at nutritional content when we pick up a packet of something, trying to eat fresh as much as possible",3
"Limiting the stuff that really doesn't make me feel better. I ""feel"" better without the carbs. My skin isn't grey. I've got energy in the morning. But that certainly doesn't mean that I've eaten my last chip butty __¡° I'll just consider it more now and enjoy it when I do.",3
"I have gone from eating soured milk and musli to eating oatmeal porrige for breakfast every weekday. Breakfast is a very functional dish on weekdays for me. I suppose it is a better choice to eat oatmeal compared to milk products. 
 
 For lunch I normally eat at restaurants so I wouldn't say I have any better food choice, I try to eat vegetarian if it is available. 
 
 For dinner it is about having time to go to the local fruit and vegetable store and the fish store to find good ingredients so I am aware about what I am eating. 
 
 I don't really eat snacks except the free fruit they have the office.",2
"If I am snacking on the go, instead of a chocolate bar, I will have a protein bite bar or something from Graze. I am not entirely sure they are healthy but they appear to be better for me with less sugar and more raw ingredients than chocolate bars. Although Graze has a lot of packaging so it probably is not the best food choice. 
 
 I work from home so breakfast, lunch and dinner are a bit blurred. 
 
 For breakfast, I now make my own smoothies in a Nutribullet. I do it all from scratch but use frozen fruit in winter. I always make sure I add ginger to the mix as an energy perk. My favourite smoothie is honey, ginger and greek yoghurt with a dash of pumpkin spices - yum!
 
 For lunch, I am much less healthy. I have a habit of going out for a croissant or some pastry. One thing I do do is make sure I have some fruit or vegetables. This could be a handful of grapes or some nuts. Even if it is a small thing that is healthier e.g. an Eat Natural Bar, it just makes me feel that I am slowly making the right steps forward. 
 
 For dinner, I always make sure I drink a lot of water, regardless of what I am eating. I have started adding a vitamin bomb to my water in winter to make sure I have all the nutrients I need. I like the EMERGEN C_ tablets but usually go for the cheaper supermarket own brands.",2.5
"1) Breakfast: Firstly, actually eating first thing is so important to set me up for the day! I've never been one to not like breakfast but I try now to make sure it's not too sweet as it messes with my blood sugar levels so I crash before lunchtime. I am a huge fan of Marmite on wholemeal toast with good quality butter, it's one of life's simple pleasures! I believe in the power of the B vitamins in Marmite and staying clear of refined bread that makes me sluggish. At the weekends, I always try to add some protein (usually veggie) e.g eggs or beans 
 2) Lunch time I try not to overload carbs to avoid a crash in the afternoon at work. Usually I base my lunch around a homemade salad and some sort of protein e.g salmon or falafel and like to create a bit of pick and mix with dips and sides to make it more interesting. Something to get excited about basically, rather than a limp sandwich on-the-go! On a really good day, I will have brought in leftover dinner such as a hearty stew, soup or chilli.
 3)Dinner I try and keep as varied as possible throughout the week. I find cooking relaxing so like to plan a nice meal with interesting ingredients at least once a week. I try to keep vegetable ingredients seasonal much more than I used to.
 4) Snacks are usually at around 11am and something a bit sweeter like dark chocolate, yoghurt or a flapjack/biscuit. If I'm trying to cut down on the sugar, I'll go for something like carrots and hummus or crackers and cheese or more natural sugars and especially like mixing dark berries with yoghurt and some toasted seeds.",4
"What it means is getting organised. I take my food to work or I end up buying cheese and ham baguettes (which are definitely not a good food choice!!)
 
 At breakfast I make porridge. Skimmed milk (which I know is important as I don__t drink tea or coffee so don__t get much calcium otherwise. I__m not a breakfast fan so it__s easy for me to skip but I make sure I eat or I pick. So porridge with added chia and linseeds for crunch and flavour, cherries or plums (I never used to eat fruit after doing weight watchers and thinking it was a waste of points! But I spoke to a nutritionist when I kept getting bad thrush and she told me how important it was, especially berries and cherries, so I do that now). Then on top I add some coconut flakes and a bit of agave syrup. It__s really good!!! Like brunch our good. I__ve surprised myself. 
 
 For snacks I crunch my way through veg I being in to stop me being tempted. I sit next to the desk of diabetes - the nickname for the end filing cabinet which is loaded with biscuits and sweets. I also get bored at work and boredom is a big eating trigger for me so I like to keep my mouth amused, as it were! I eat the seaweed thins by itsu, have one can of diet soda on standby, and then things like miso soup (itsu again) and flavored teas. Chewing gum is also very useful. Am I hungry or am I bored/distressed is a huge one for me.
 
 Lunch I bring in. It__s often chilli and brown rice. The brown rice is a new one - I like it but not really as much as white fluffy rice. I make it up on advance and freeze it so it__s good to go. And I make chilli with turkey mince not beef, it__s lovely! If I__m going out for tea I__ll have homemade soup instead to try to balance out my food intake.
 
 And at dinner, whatever really! Often a stir fry. A few years ago we tried out tofu and I like the presses stuff. The big difference here is that we eat at the table together not in front of the tv. Then for pudding I__ve always got pure fruit ice lollies. Del monte or sainsburys own brand. No added sugar but a nice sweet treat to round off the meal. And maybe a square of chocolate.",4
"Breakfast 
 Oats porridge in mornings with seeds, nuts, almond butter, and fruits
 
 Alpro instead milk 
 
 Lunch 
 Having soups and stews made from slow cooker with sourdough bread, corn or rye thins and hummus or avocado 
 
 
 Dinner 
 Miso soup with seaweed and cubed tofu as a side with main meal 
 
 Introducing fermented foods like kimchi, pickled vegetables as a small side",2
"I__ve mostly replaced sweet snacks (cakes, mars bars etc) with fruit & nuts. I say mostly, I still love my sweet snacks occasionally. 
 
 I make sure I always have breakfast whereas I often used to skip it and then eat rubbish mid morning. 
 
 I also try and have a good lunch and a good dinner. I won__t eat too late either",2.5
"Breakfast __¡° skip breakfast (intermittent fasting) This is killing me, because I love breakfast.
 
 Lunch __¡° eat less but more tasty (did you know M&S do a charcuterie pack for a quid?)
 
 Dinner __¡° Umami is better than chocolate! 
 
 Snacking __¡° Iberico cheese and almonds.",3
"Lunches, since I am not aware about the background of the food in the lunch restaurants, it doesn't feel like lunch restaurants care so much about this topic.",2
"Every time I travel my healthy eating goes out of the window. It starts the moment I eat plane food and just goes downhill from there. Usually when I am travelling, I am adapting to a different time zone and end up eating ""on-the-go"" a lot. Recently I was in Denmark and our work__s dinner was healthy but there was a lot of food - lots! Then as soon as I was on my own, I wanted to discover more of Copenhagen and popped into McDonalds so I could eat food as I was walking around the city. I also stay in Airbnbs a lot but never feel comfortable using the kitchen, just in case I break something so home cooked food while travelling does not happen. 
 
 Another time that I eat unhealthy is when I am on a tight deadline for a client. If they want something ___now__ I definitely hit the caffeine (coffee or Coca Cola) and sugary snacks (e.g. peanut M&Ms) to power me through in order to meeting deadlines. 
 
 Being a women, when it is ___the time of the month__ I just struggle to be healthy. I want to eat food like crisps, chocolate and creamy yoghurts. I also don__t want to exercise at all and want to sleep as much as possible.",3
"Definitely - when tired, stressed or hungover it's incredibly hard to forward plan or be mindful about food choices. When I'm out drinking I find the better food choices happen earlier on, so maybe while I'm drinking with a meal but if it's a big night then late night snacks or fast food are usually pretty greasy and carb heavy! When I'm at work and haven't had the chance to bring in homemade lunch, eating supermarket or takeout food usually means I choose something that will give me a quick fix, in terms of sugar, fat or processed generally.",2.5
"Restaurants. I live in London and love to eat out. And where you__re in a restaurant, it__s a treat! All bets are off.
 
 Also I find it very difficult if I__m not prepared at work. If I__m relying on the canteen or popping out then it__s all sandwiches as far as the eye can see. 
 
 But I take a week long view so as long as there__s balance across the proven I can relax. 
 
 My main concern is that if I don__t keep an eye on things my weight will fluctuate so quickly. And I can see when I__m rundown, my lips go dry and cracked, my skin gets tired - I don__t want that. Looking after myself, self care, is so important. Someone very recently described the foods they liked not in taste but the way it made them feel in their body - totally new on me!",2.5
"Socialising with family and friends and special occasions where it__s culturally expected to have very rich, heavy foods (e.g meat, alcohol) 
 
 Travelling abroad for work and leisure might be dependent on where you are and whether you have access to local recommendations that are also healthier choices.",2
"Most definitely! Going out to eat is always an occasion where there are often lots of unhealthy choices on the menu. 
 It__s harder when we have lots of kids in the house, when the kids have sleep overs and they want sweet stuff and ask for pancakes in the morning. Often it__s hard if you__re away from home on holiday and they don__t have the same quality of fresh foods in the shops and you find yourself limited",2.5
"ALL THE TIME. 
 
 Especially as the kids are still eating what they bloody well please. But the payoff once that pang has gone makes it tolerable.",2.5
"I eat oatmeal porrige everyday for breakfast, it is healthy, good, cheap, environmental friendly etc. However, I don't like all oat products such as oat milk or oat sour cream etc.",2
"In winter, I eat Quaker Oats for breakfast - mainly the sachets with golden syrup in them. They are pure nostalgia for me. I used to eat this as a kid to warm me up. 
 
 I do kind of associate oats with Quaker Oats and my grandma. Sometimes I make flapjacks, but once again it is more for nostalgia effect. They are more like a comfort food for me when I am feeling a bit low. 
 
 I do sometimes eat these yoghurts - http://nomadic-dairy.com/ - when I buy a Boots Meal Deal. The clusters yoghurts contain oats. I associate them with flying, travel and adventure because I only buy Meal Deals in airports or before business meetings in London. 
 
 I don__t use them in any other part of my diet. Although, I should because they would be great to add them to the breakfast smoothies I make with my Nutribullet. 
 
 I generally associate oats with being old fashion, basic and a comfort food with the exception of Oatly. I keep seeing Oatly ads everywhere and it looks really interesting and quick cool and hip. I just need to go out and find a local cafe that serves it.",3.5
"Oats are definitely more important in my diet now. I've switched from almond to oat milk for cereal and find it a nice alternative in coffee when in a cafe. When it's cold I'm a big fan of porridge and like baking with oats generally, I find they keep me feeling level headed for longer when combined with sugar. So for instance, if I ate a flapjack I wouldn't feel as tired later in the day than if I ate a chocolate bar.",2.5
"Wow, what a question! Yep, eat my porridge every day. In summer I switch to oatcakes sometimes. I often have them on standby at work.
 
 My perception of oats then...
 
 Filling, good for you, a good grain to incorporate into your diet. Not overly processed which is good.
 
 In all honesty though, not that inspiring! Can be a bit dull - they need some love and flavour added (as per my lovely breakfast).
 
 Never thought of them beyond breakfast food or an oatcake snack. Would struggle to incorporate them into my diet with savoury main meals. 
 
 I__ve never been asked what i thought about oats - there you go, a world exclusive!",3
Oats makes my gut feel more settled and grounded in the mornings. It has helped a lot with my IBS and digestive issues in the past. Oats is also great for my skin as I suffer from eczema occasionally.,2.5
"Absolutely love them! I usually have porridge every morning for breakfast, with nuts and seeds. I also often drink warm oat milk. I used to have a real hot chocolate addiction which I__ve kicked thanks to discovering oat milk! The children often have porridge for breakfast too and I love being able to send the kids to school knowing that they__ve had a great start to the day anstheyll have the energy to see them through to lunch",2.5
"Not at this very moment because of the carbs thing.

 As a general rule, yes.

 They're yummy.",2.5
"Security, protection, necessity.
 Though it would be really nice to live in a world where money don__t matter, it is not the case in everyday life. I could never say that money is there to spend to the last dime without thinking of tomorrow. For me money is a way to feel secure, to know I will always be able to spend without stress should something happen. It is my anchor. It is something I have always experienced and taught from a very young age. Money is not there to be spent without thinking, it is there for a need that may occur, something like sickness or if there is a housing need etc. I have adopted my father__s thinking as I have seen friends struggle when they had sudden needs and trying to get quick loans to cover those needs. Therefore, I never spend my entire salary on just having fun or buying things. I always need to have money aside for when I really need them even if that means I will cut my expenses from things like going to restaurants or going to the hairdresser every week/month. And if there is a need, I want to be able to use that money immediately without waiting on funds or needing to sell shares. This is why I need to have a good amount of money in the bank which I can use anytime, anywhere. Also, it is the reason why I must always find ways to earn more money, be that from doing ad hoc jobs on top of my job or investing in housing and getting rent.",2.5

Sometimes you look at something and you don't know why you want to keep looking at it. It provokes something in you. Sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't. 'Inside out beauty' is understanding that everyone and everything has the potential to be beautiful - even if on the surface, the person or thing does not conform to societal 'norms' or 'ideals' of beauty. An ugly duckling can be a beautiful swan on the inside. A neglected plant has the potential can be a blooming flower.",2

"Yesterday (Sunday, 5/19/19), I had four distinct gaming experiences that functioned somewhat independently. In the morning, I took a break from a side project I was working on to get a few quick games of Overwatch (PS4) in just to take my mind off the project for a bit and refresh. A few hours later some of my friends jumped on Overwatch to play (we have a dedicated group text), so I jumped back on to join them. We all met a few years ago while working together, but we're now spread out across three states. We made our own ""team"" (we had jerseys and koozies made ...), and Overwatch in particular is part of the reason we make sure to check in on each other several times a week__¡±it keeps us together across space and time in the ways that simple text messages couldn't. For several small bursts throughout the day I jumped onto mobile (Brawlstars, iPhone) mainly just to do my ""dailies,"" which is most often just something to pass the time enjoyably while waiting on something/someone else. Finally, before dinner I played a boardgames (Terraforming Mars) with my girlfriend and her family. It's a great opportunity for us to catch up and spend some time together interacting in a way that's rewarding as well__¡±allowing us to compete (as well as work together) in a way that more passive activities (e.g., Netflix) just don't allow.",2

"I've worked for the better part of my life in an corporate environment. Even though i design for a living, I'm always answerable to a superior in my workspace. I did this for sometime with the hope that i would always quit, but i never got around to it. The financial stability, the friends i had made and being able to have a good lifestyle had made me complacent and i always putting quitting on the backburner. After doing this for sometime, i started hating what i do, myself, my health deteriorated. The comfort became toxic for me and i wasn't happy anymore. After some soul searching and really deep diving into why i was happy, i came to the conclusion that i was fed up of creating these works of art and making other people benefit and profit of me. I knew i had the skillset to make it on my own, but the stability again showed its ugly head. I realized i had to take the plunge and risk it all. I knew i'd always hate myself if i didn't try. So one morning i got up and without second guessing i quit my job. After quitting it was stressful for a while and there's alwasy up and downs. But i now work for myself. I work to make my self look good. I get up in the morning and i don't hate myself. This is the best decision i have taken and I've never felt freer.

There's a wonderful breeze in the air. The ground beneath you is breathing a beautiful green.

"I am not sure I can explain DeFi at all. I have tried to understand it but my knowledge is still minimum. I think that DeFi is basically virtual banks with no headquarters or branches. It is all virtual. So you have virtual money that you invest in virtual shares and you can buy only limited things as these money can__t be used everywhere. That is also something I can__t get my head around; why would someone want to have virtual money that they can__t use everywhere? It__s like saying you invest all your money in bonds which you can__t use, you can just see them going up and down in the share market and have mini heart attacks every time a share goes down. I am not saying that you shouldn__t invest, I just feel that DeFi can__t really replace real money because they can not be used widely or immediately. The only good thing I think there is in DeFi is that you don__t have the expenses that a bank requires or the checks for getting loans, and you could probably use the money in different countries without having to exchange them to the local currency. But again, you would be limited in using them.

Yoga helps you mentally, so that in the end, you don't really care what you look like - as the benefits go far beyond the aesthetic and the superficial. It's all about how great you feel inside. That's inside out beauty for me.",2.5
"I work a lot in the make-up/beauty industry as a detail/parts and hand model so I feel like I have gotten a good look at what products and techniques industry professionals use. I have always liked make-up as a way to switch up my look and to make myself feel more confident. Little things, like curling my lashes or putting just a bit of blush on, makes me feel somehow ten times more put together. Beauty is so personal and everyone has their own history and struggles with self acceptance so I view make-up as such an empowering tool and great way to have fun with your own personal style. For me, quality products have become more and more important to my routine and I have come to be quite loyal to certains brands. I also have a masters degree in luxury brand management so I am always fascinated by what luxury brands do (in terms or marketing, branding, & touch points) to form deep connections and loyalties with their customers so I find this project extra compelling from that perspective.",2

She goes wherever I go, she sleeps on my feet every night, she stays close when i am working or doing yoga... we are buddies, family, I feel like a mother to her sometimes. She is funny and expressive. I like to talk to her, to take care of her. She has a lot of character and I am so proud of her as a cat :) My friends and family cherish her. I adopted her 9 years ago when she was 1 month old. She was so tiny and was missing her mom. We have been through many cicles together: we traveled cross-country, visited my parents in the south, moved to the northeast together.... I love to see her reacting to things. And at the end of the day, she is my family. My parents are my ""family of origin"" but she, and the partner and kids that will come one day, will be my family.

Its a whole other experience when one is actually holding something physical in ones hand. I had lost that feeling since shopping online for so long. I ended up spending a bomb at the place, but it didn't really bother me. I ended up buying things that i wouldn't have bought online only for the fact that you really don't know what you want till its presented in front of you. That was really a great day and I've now been going there regularly since that first visit.",1.5

"i think the way i approach life, work and money has evolved a lott over time and differs hugely between my parents let alone my grandparents being a second generation Black British citizen. I
 In so many ways even though I am black I acknowledge my privilege living off the trauma, discriminations, blood, sweat and tears that my grandfather and parents had to go through to even be acknowledged as a citizen in the UK let alone an equal one.
  Growing up as working class citizens my parents worked really really hard to provide in the best way that they could to provide me and my siblings with a good and enriched life. Though we were never really rolling in money, they always did the best that they could even when times were tough.
 Personally the topic of money for me especially as a child was always a difficult one as i subconsciously associated it with guilt and the idea of spending money on non-essentials or even things that i actually needed, made me feel so bad and just uncomfortable and in some ways even undeserving. 
 I also had at the back of my mind - this money could go towards something else or someone else and often missed out on things that I could have had if I asked.

While I know I am starting to understand it more as I gone through several jobs, I know that your mindset can change hitting different obstacles. My parents way of approaching life is to appreciate the downtime they have and relax and to spoil themselves occasionally.
